# The Linux Operating System Family

#### The Linux Operating System Family

**_Linux_** is a family of operating systems based on the Linux kernel, the central core of the OS that manages all components in the system. The Linux kernel was developed by Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds in 1991, while he was a student at the University of Helsinki.

FOSS, the GNU Project, and the Unix design philosophy have all played an important role in the development of Linux. Torvalds released the Linux kernel under version 2 of the GPL. Most distributions of Linux add GNU software written by Stallman and other free software components on top of the Linux kernel. In other words, Linux is the first complete operating system family to qualify as FOSS, and like GNU software, it follows the principles of simplicity and modularity set forth in the Unix design philosophy.

**_GNU/Linux_**

Because most members of the Linux OS family incorporate GNU utilities along with the Linux kernel, the FSF prefers to call the OS family "GNU/Linux" rather than just "Linux." This supports the idea that the Linux kernel was the "missing piece" to the GNU Project, and gives credit to GNU for its tools and the free software movement itself. However, Torvalds and others disagree with this assessment, and the name "Linux" is by far the most common way of referring to the OS family.

**Advantages of Using Linux**

To summarize, the following are some of the major advantages of using Linux:

-   Its FOSS nature promotes transparency.
-   Its design emphasizes simplicity and modularity.
-   It is highly customizable.
-   It is highly reliable and stable.
-   It has strong integration with several major programming languages, like C, C++, Python, Ruby, etc.
-   It places an emphasis on security and privacy.
-   Most distributions are free of monetary cost.
-   It has a passionate community willing to provide support.

**Disadvantages of Using Linux** No system is perfect, including Linux. The following are some potential disadvantages:

-   It has a sharper learning curve than other general purpose operating systems like Windows and macOS.
-   Desktop software is not as well-supported as it is in other operating systems like Windows and macOS.
-   There is no definitive or official version, which can be confusing to new users.
-   With some exceptions, there is no official vendor-provided support.
