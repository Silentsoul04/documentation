# Identify the Linux Design Philosophy

Unlike other operating systems you may have worked with, the history of **Linux** is driven by a philosophy of openness and transparency. This philosophy has informed the design of Linux as an operating system, as well as its application in the business world. It's important for you to understand this philosophy and how it will ultimately have an impact on your day-to-day operations.

#### **Open Source Software**

**Open source software (OSS)** refers to computer code that any user is permitted to view, copy, and modify for any reason, as well as distribute to anyone. Users are granted these rights when the author of the software releases the source code under one of several open source licenses. The opposite of OSS is proprietary softwareâ€”software that is released under a license that imposes restrictions on one or more of the rights just mentioned (view, copy, modify, distribute).

OSS provides several advantages to users, administrators, and programmers alike. Perhaps the most important element of OSS is that it encourages the ongoing improvement of software in a collaborative, community-driven environment. Individuals or groups of developers may build upon another developer's work to create enhanced or customized software, all while avoiding legal issues. There are many examples of OSS, one of which is the Linux kernel.
