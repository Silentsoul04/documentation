#### **Shell Tips and Tricks**

While the command-line interface can be intimidating, there are several ways of making it easier to work with and more efficient. As you get more comfortable with Bash, you may find you prefer working at the CLI much of the time.

Here are a few tips to help make working at the command-line easier:

-   **Tab completion:** Get in the habit of using tab completion for speed and to minimize typos.
-   **Use history instead of re-writing long commands**: When you make a typographical error in a command or file name, do not manually re-type the entire line. Repeat the line with the mistake by hitting the **Up Arrow** key one time, and then use the **Left** and **Right Arrow** keys to move to the mistake so that you can correct it.
-   **Read the command backward**: When troubleshooting your commands, start from the right and read to the left. This method makes it a great deal easier to notice missing or duplicate characters.
-   **Clear the screen**: Enter the clear command to clear the CLI of all text. This is useful when you're starting a new task and want to eliminate any distracting information from past command entries.
