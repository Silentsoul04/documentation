# Other Built-In Help Options

#### **Other Built-In Help Options**

In addition to the man command, Linux offers other built-in options for help.

Help Option | Description
--------- | ---------
apropos | Searches the NAME section of all man pages for the keyword that the user provides. The NAME section usually contains a brief, one-sentence description of the command after the name itself. The apropos command is therefore useful when you'd like to perform some task, but don't know the name of the appropriate command(s). The syntax of this command is apropos {keyword}
whatis | Displays the brief description of the given command, including commands that appear in multiple sections. This is essentially the opposite of apropos â€”you know the command name, but want to figure out what it does. The syntax of this command is whatis {command}
info | Displays the info page of a command. Info pages are essentially an alternative to man pages, and are favored by the GNU project. Although they have features such as hyperlinking and can easily generate HTML pages and PDF files, info pages are not as widely adopted as man pages. The syntax of this command is info {command}
\--help | Displays a quick summary of the usage of a command and a list of arguments that can be used. This feature can be used with most commands in Linux. The syntax of this command is <command> --help or <command> -h
/usr/share/doc/ | This directory contains documentation for libraries, system utilities, and other software packages installed on the system. Each software package has its own subfolder in this directory, and each subfolder usually contains separate documents that list the authors, licensing information, installation instructions, general README, etc.

#### Online Documentation

The Internet is one of the best places to go to for help with Linux. There is not one single online source that is necessarily better than the others; the choice often comes down to what type of help you're looking for. The following table lists some of the best online sources for Linux documentation.

Online Source | Description
--------- | ----------
Official distro documentation | Some of the more popular Linux distributions provide their users with documentation that applies specifically to that distro. This documentation often includes the release notes of different versions and updates, an installation guide, a virtualization guide, and more. For example, the official documentation for Ubuntu is available at [https://help.ubuntu.com/](https://help.ubuntu.com/) .
Linux Documentation Project (LDP) | The LDP is an all-volunteer project that provides a comprehensive resource for Linux documentation. The documentation comes in many forms, from HOWTOs that are step-by-step procedures for performing a specific task in Linux, to Guides, which include suggestions and best practices on a variety of Linux topics. The LDP also includes FAQs, man pages, and other types of documentation. The LDP is available at [https://www.tldp.org/](https://www.tldp.org/) .
Linux man-pages project | This is the official source of man pages for Linux kernel and C library interfaces that are available to user space programs, i.e., code that runs outside of the kernel. This project is available at [https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/](https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/) .
GNU coreutils manual | This is the official source of documentation for the GNU core utilities, or coreutils. The coreutils is the package of GNU software tools that is compiled with the Linux kernel, along with other software, to form a Linux distribution. This manual is available at [https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/) .
