# Manual Pages

Linux **_manual_** pages, or man pages, contain the complete documentation that is specific to each Linux command. The man pages are available on Linux systems by default. The man page for a specific command is displayed using the man command. They usually include information such as the name of the command, its syntax, a description of its purpose, the options it supports, examples of common usage of the command, and a list of related commands.

Man pages are perhaps the most immediate source of help available when you need to learn more about what a command does or how to operate it. They are especially useful in situations where Internet access is not available. However, man pages can be difficult to parse for someone not familiar with how they're formatted.

> _Note: Man pages are presented in simple ASCII text format for ease of access._

**_SYNTAX_** The syntax of the man command is man {command}

**_SYNOPSIS Format_** Most of the components of a man page are self-explanatory, but the **SYNOPSIS** component can be somewhat confusing to new users. This part of a man page provides the syntax of the command along with some example use cases. These use cases are formatted as such:

-   **bold** text should be typed exactly as shown.
-   _italic_ text should be replaced with the appropriate argument. Note that this may be formatted differently on certain systems, like underlined text or colored text.
-   \[-abc\] indicates that all arguments within the brackets are optional.
-   \-a|-b indicates that the arguments on either side of the pipe (|) cannot be used together.
-   _italic_ text with ... (ellipsis) after it indicates that the argument can be repeated.
-   \[_italic_\] text with ... after it indicates that the entire expression within the brackets can be repeated.

**_man COMMAND OPTIONS_**

The man command supports different options. Some of the frequently used options are listed here.

Option | Description
------- | -------
\-a | Finds all entries matching the query.
\-D | Displays debugging information.
\-f | Displays a short description of the command along with the man pages/sections.
\-h | Displays help options for the man command.
\-k | Lists all manual pages/sections containing the keyword along with their location.
\-K | Searches for the specified string on all pages.
\-t | Formats the man pages to enable printing.

  
**_MAN PAGE SECTIONS_**

Man pages for commands may be listed under one or more sections. A section defines what category the command belongs to. When a command has more than one section listed, it means that documentation for the same command is available from more than one source. These sections are identified by the number displayed beside the command; for example, fsck (8)

Various man page sections are provided in the following table.

Section Number | What It Contains
------ | ------
1 | General commands
2 | System calls
3 | C library functions
4 | Special files (usually found in /dev)
5 | File formats and conventions
6 | Games and screensavers
7 | Miscellaneous
8 | System administration commands and daemons
