# Interactive Help

Online documentation is a quick and easy reference point, but it's not always the best source for answering your Linux questions, especially if those questions are complex or apply to unconventional scenarios. These questions are often best answered by interacting with other people directly, whether in real-time or asynchronously. The following table lists some of the major sources of interactive help on the Internet for Linux issues.

Online Source | Description
-------- | --------
Usenet newsgroups | Usenet newsgroups are online discussion repositories similar to bulletin board systems, and are some of the oldest forms of Internet-based discussion. Users post text or files to a newsgroup, and other members of the group can view and respond to these posts, which are organized in a threaded manner. Newsgroups tend to be focused on specific subject matter; some newsgroups focused on providing Linux help include comp.os.linux.help , comp.os.linux.answers, and comp.os.linux.admin.
Mailing lists | Internet-based mailing lists are similar to newsgroups in that they involve threaded discussions among members of a specific community. "Posts" are essentially email messages sent to every user on a distribution list. You can find distro-specific mailing lists for several major distros, or you can subscribe to more general Linux mailing lists, such as those listed at [https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo) .
Q&A websites | Question and answer websites enable users to post a question on some topic, and other users can answer or otherwise comment on the question. Many of these sites have functionality for users to "like" or "upvote" questions they feel are useful, or answers they feel offer a good solution. The most popular Q&A site for IT topics is Stack Exchange, which has a Unix & Linux category available at [https://unix.stackexchange.com/](https://unix.stackexchange.com/) .
Forums and social media | Internet forums are typically threaded posts, similar to newsgroups or mailing lists, but use web protocols to deliver the content. Some forums encourage users to post questions to the community, and other users respond to the posts with guidance. Aside from distro-specific forums, one popular forum for Linux support is available at [https://www.linuxquestions.org/](https://www.linuxquestions.org/) . In addition, some social media sites, like Reddit, offer a forum-like discussion platform for soliciting help on specific topicsâ€”for example, [https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/) .
