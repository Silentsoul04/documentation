# Get Help with Linux

Now that you are familiar with the Linux shell, you may want to begin using commands in your system. However, there will be times when you need assistance with the various available commands. In this topic, you will identify the help and support options offered by Linux.

#### **Linux Documentation**

Documentation is a necessity in any major computing project, and Linux is no different. Documentation helps users of the Linux operating system, no matter their role or experience level, to perform a wide range of activities and resolve a wide range of issues. However, just like there is not one official form of Linux, neither is there a single, authoritative source of documentation. Documentation is spread across multiple sources that appear in multiple forms, each one suited to a particular context.

Some of major sources of Linux documentation include:

-   Manual pages
-   Built-in help commands
-   Online documentation projects
-   Usenet newsgroups
-   Internet mailing lists
-   Question and answer websites
-   Forums and social media
-   Books and other print resources
