# Bash Syntax

#### **Bash Syntax**

Command-line administration includes the idea of "syntax," or the proper way of structuring a command and any supporting information. The many CLIs have their own unique ways of entering information. You need to understand this syntax to be able to effectively communicate with the interface.

Bash shell syntax contains three main components: the command, options to modify the command, and an argument for the command to act upon. It is common for new users to Bash to forget the spaces between the three components.

The basic syntax of Bash is therefore: command \[-options\] \[arguments\]

> Note: For command syntax, this course uses the convention by which square brackets denote an optional component and curly brackets denote a required component. In some cases, a command can be run without options or arguments and still work.

The following table lists an example of each type of basic syntax format using the ls command.

Syntax Format | Command | Description
---------- | ---------- | ---------
Command only | ls | Lists directory contents with default output.
Command with options | ls -la | Lists directory contents in long format (\-l) and showing "hidden" files (\-a).
Command with an argument | ls /var/log | Lists directory contents of /var/logdirectory with default output.
Command with options and an argument | ls -la /var/log | Lists directory contents of /var/logdirectory in long format and showing "hidden" files.

**_ERRORS_**

If you fail to enter a command in the proper syntax, Bash will return an error. Typically, these error messages are descriptive and will help you to understand what Bash expects. For "command not found" errors, check for typos in the command. For "no such file or directory" errors, check for typos in the directory, file, or file path names.
