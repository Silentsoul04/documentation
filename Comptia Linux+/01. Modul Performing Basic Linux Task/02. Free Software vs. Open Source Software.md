# Free Software vs. Open Source Software

The term **free software** is often used interchangeably with OSS, and both share a great deal of overlap. However, some draw a distinction between the two. Richard Stallman, the founder of the free software movement, argues that the terms share different valuesâ€”in his words, "Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement." In other words, OSS is most concerned with fostering open collaboration, whereas free software is most concerned with upholding users' rights. Note that "free" is being used in the sense of freedom, not in the sense of having no monetary cost.

In an attempt to resolve this terminology dispute, some developers have adopted the term **free and open source software (FOSS)** to describe any project that embodies the values of both movements.
