# Shells

#### Shells

A _**shell**_ envelops the core portion of the operating system—referred to as the kernel—permitting the user to pass commands and information to the kernel. The kernel is also able to respond back to the user via the shell. The shell can be thought of as an interpreter between human and kernel languages. Linux users issue commands in the shell to tell the operating system what to do. The operating system responds back to the user with the results.

A shell can be implemented as either a CLI or a graphical user interface (GUI). The following table lists some common CLI-based shells that are used in Linux.

Shell | Description
---------- | ----------
Bourne shell (sh) | This is the original Unix shell that is still available on Linux systems, though not widely used.
Bash (bash) | This is the default Linux shell and a replacement for the Bourne shell. Its full name comes from the term Bourne-again shell.
C shell (csh) | This shell is based on the C programming language and was designed to support C language development environments.
KornShell (ksh) | This shell uses the features of the C shell with the syntax of the Bourne shell. It is common on Unix systems.

**MORE ON BASH**

As a Linux user, it is essential to be comfortable using the default Bash shell. Virtually every Linux distribution will use this shell as the translator between the user and the system. It is possible to install and use other shells in Linux if users are more comfortable with them, but the default will almost always be Bash.

Some characteristics of Bash include:

-   It's been around for a very long time, so it is well documented with many existing scripts.
-   It's commonly used in Linux and macOS (where it is also the default) and with various other operating systems.
-   It's not always consistent, since there have been a great many modifications by various groups since its creation.
-   It includes history and tab completion features.
-   It's very flexible.
