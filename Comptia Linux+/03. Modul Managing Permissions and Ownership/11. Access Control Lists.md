# Access Control Lists

#### **Access Control Lists**

An _access control list (ACL)_ is a list of permissions attached to an object. ACLs can be used for situations where the traditional file permission concept does not suffice. ACLs enable you to assign permissions to individual users or groups even if these do not correspond to the object's owner or group.

For example, members of two department groups may need different levels of access to the same resource. Group 1 might need r/w/x to a directory, whereas Group 2 only needs r/x access. By using ACLs, you are able to grant different levels of access to different users, groups, and even processes. ACLs enable a more granular level of control.

#### **THE getfacl COMMAND**

The getfacl command is used to retrieve the ACLs of files and directories.

The basic output format of the getfacl command shows metadata about the object including its owner, its group, any SUID/SGID/sticky bit flags set, the standard permissions associated with the object, and the individual permission entries for users and groups.

> _Note: Directories can also have default ACL entries that pertain to any new files or subdirectories created within them._

#### **THE setfacl COMMAND**

The `setfacl` command is used to change the permissions associated with the ACL of a file or directory.

The `setfacl` command has several options, some of the most common of which are described in the following table.

Option | Used To
---- | ----
\-R | Recursively set ACL options for directories and their contents.
\-s | Set the ACL of an object, replacing any existing ACL.
\-m | Modify the existing ACL of an object.
\-x | Remove entries from an existing ACL.
\-b | Remove all ACL entries (not including the standard permissions).

  
**_SYNTAX_**  
The syntax of the setfacl command is `setfacl [-bR] [-mx {acl_spec}] {file/directory names}`

**_ACL SPECIFICATION_**  
The ACL specification can be formatted in one of several ways:

-   When working with users, the format is `u:{user name}:{permissions}`
-   When working with groups, the format is `g:{group name}:{permissions}`

**_EXAMPLE_**  
The following is an example of modifying the ACL on a directory where the user http is given read access:

`setfacl -m u:http:r-- /home/directory`
