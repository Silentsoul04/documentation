# chmod SYMBOLIC MODE

#### **chmod SYMBOLIC MODE**

The chmod command supports two modes: symbolic mode and absolute mode. Symbolic mode enables you to set permissions using three components, namely:

-   Permission contexts: u/g/o/a (a applies the permissions to all three contexts).
-   Permission operators: +/-/=
-   Permission attributes: r/w/x

Permission operators determine whether a permission is to be granted or removed.

Operator | Description
----- | -----
\+ |  Grants permissions.
\- | Denies permissions.
\= | Assigns permissions exactly as provided, rather than being additive or subtractive.

**_SYNTAX_** In symbolic mode, the syntax of the chmod command is:

`chmod {access context}{operators}{permission attributes} {file/directory names}` 

As an example, to add read and write permissions to myfile for the owner and the group:

`chmod u+rw,g+rw myfile`
