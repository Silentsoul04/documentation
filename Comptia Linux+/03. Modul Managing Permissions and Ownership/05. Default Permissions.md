# Default Permissions

#### **Default Permissions**

In Linux, default permissions are assigned to newly created files and directories based on user privileges. For files created by the root user, the default permissions are 644, which means that the root user has read and write permissions, while group users and others will have only read permission. For directories created by the root user, the default permissions are 755, which means that the root user has read, write, and execute permissions, while group users and others will have only read and execute permissions. In the case of users with limited access rights, Linux assigns permissions of 664 for newly created files and 775 for newly created directories.

These default permissions are determined by the user file creation mask, or umask. However, the default permissions may be altered by the root user.

#### **THE umask COMMAND**

The umask command alters the default permissions on newly created files and directories. Changing default permissions can be useful if you'd like to automatically control how new objects can be used, rather than changing these permissions manually on every new object.

With umask, you set default permissions using octal numeric format. However, instead of specifying which permissions to set, you specify which permissions to mask, or clear, from the default. For example, the default permissions for non-executable files in Linux are 666 (rw-rw-rw-). If you want the owner to retain these permissions, but you want the group and others to only have read access, you'll need to set the umask to 022. Each number is explained as follows, in order:

-   0 means that the current owner permissions should not be masked at all, i.e., left as read and write.
-   2 means that the group permissions should be masked by 2, i.e., subtract 2 from the default (6) and you get 4. Group members now only have read access.
-   2 does the same thing as the previous number, but for other users.

You can use the umask command directly in the CLI to set the default permissions for that session, or you can set the default permissions for each user in their `.bashrc` file.

> _Note: Because it subtracts from the default (`666`), the `umask` command cannot force newly created files to set the execute bit._
