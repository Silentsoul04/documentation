The standard read, write, and execute permissions are good enough in most circumstances. However, there are additional permissions and attributes that you can use to restrict access in a more specialized way.

#### **Special Permissions**

Special permissions are used when normal permissions become inadequate. With special permissions, less privileged users are allowed to execute a file by assuming the privileges of the file's owner or group This enables the user to temporarily take on these higher level privileges in a limited context.
