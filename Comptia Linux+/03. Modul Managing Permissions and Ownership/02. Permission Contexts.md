# Permission Contexts

#### **Permission Contexts**

Permission attributes on files and folders (directories) are applied to one of several contexts, or the types of users and entities that you can give permission to. These contexts are:

-   **Owner (u)**: The owner of the file or directory, also simply referred to as the user.
-   **Group (g)**: The file or directory's group and all users belonging to that group.
-   **Other (o)**: All other users (neither owner nor group member).

#### **Permission String**

The output of the ls -l command shows the permission string for a file or directory. The permission string contains 11 characters.

-   The first character indicates the type of file; d for directory and hyphen ( - ) for file.
-   Characters at the second, third, and fourth positions denote owner permissions.
-   Characters at the fifth, sixth, and seventh positions denote group permissions.
-   Characters at the eight, ninth, and tenth positions denote other permissions.
-   The final character indicates the access method for the file; period (.) for SELinux security context and plus (+) for any other combination of alternative access methods.

#### **THE chmod COMMAND**

The chmod command enables you to modify the permissions of a file or directory. Only the owner of the file or directory or the system administrator can change the permissions of the object.
