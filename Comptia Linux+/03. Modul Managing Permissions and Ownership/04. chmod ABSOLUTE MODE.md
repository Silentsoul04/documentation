# chmod ABSOLUTE MODE

#### **chmod ABSOLUTE MODE**

The other chmod mode, absolute mode, uses octal (base-8) numbers to specify permissions. Each permission (r/w/x) has an associated number.

Octal Number | Attribute
---- | ----
4 | Read
2 | Write
1 | Execute

  
By adding the octal numbers for the permissions you want to grant, you get the overall permission number to assign to a directory or file. For example, full permissions (read, write, and execute) are equivalent to 4 + 2 + 1, or 7. Read and write permissions are equivalent to 4 + 2, or 6. Complete permissions are expressed as a three-digit number, where each digit corresponds to the owner, the group, and others, respectively.

**_SYNTAX_**  
In absolute mode, the syntax of the chmod command is `chmod {number} {file/directory name}`

**_COMMON PERMISSIONS IN DIFFERENT MODES_**  
The following table compares how the different chmod modes represent commonly assigned permissions.

Absolute Mode | Symbolic Mode
---- | ----
755 | u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx
700 | u=rwx,g=,o=
644 | u=rw,g=r,o=r
600 | u=rw,g=,o=
  
**_THREE-DIGIT AND FOUR-DIGIT MODES_**  
When written in octal, numeric format, file permissions typically have three digits, each digit corresponding to the user, group, and others permissions. However, file permissions may also be written with four digits, with the new, leading digit signifying any advanced permissions to be defined (or 0, for none). For example, the base permissions for non-executable files in Linux are rw-rw-rw-, or 666. This is equivalent to the octal format of 0666.
