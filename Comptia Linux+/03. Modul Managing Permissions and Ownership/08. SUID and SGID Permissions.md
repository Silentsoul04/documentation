# SUID and SGID Permissions

In Linux, two main special permissions are set user ID (SUID) and set group ID (SGID). **_SUID_**, or setuid, is the permission that allows a user to have similar permissions as the owner of the file. Certain executable files and commands, like passwd, require access to additional resources that the user may not have explicit permissions to. Instead of granting those permissions individually, the passwd command is configured so that any user will execute it as root (the owner), giving them permission to the additional resources.

**_SGID_**, or setgid, is the permission that allows a user to have similar permissions as the group owner of the file. In addition to files, SGID can also be set on directories. Any subdirectories created in this directory will automatically **_inherit_** the SGID permission. Likewise, all new files and subdirectories created in this directory will inherit the directory's group ID, rather than the group ID of the user who created the object. This inheritance is useful because users in a shared environment don't need to change their group when they create objects in the directory. Note that the SGID permission is not applied to existing objects in the directory, nor is it applied to objects that are moved from other locations into the directory.

SUID and SGID are both set using the chmod command, and you can do so using either symbolic mode or absolute mode. When using `ls -al` to see permissions, the execute permission for the owner will appear as s for the SUID, and the execute permission for the group will appear as `s` for the SGID

**_SYNTAX_** The following is the syntax for setting the SUID on a file, using symbolic and absolute mode, respectively:

`chmod u+s {file names}
chmod 4### {file names}` 

Note the last three bits in absolute mode are whatever standard permissions you choose.

The following is the syntax for setting the SGID on a directory, using symbolic and absolute mode, respectively:

`chmod g+s {directory names}
chmod 2### {directory names}` 

Removing the SUID and SGID is as simple as using the - (minus) operator in symbolic mode, or setting the first permission bit to 0 in absolute mode.
