# Modul Managing Files and Directories

In the previous lesson, you created a foundation for your Linux system by managing how the system and its data is stored. Now, you'll take a more high-level approach to managing the data itself. By managing files and directories, you'll be able to quickly create, retrieve, and otherwise process data so that it provides the most benefit to your organization and your day-to-day administrative tasks.

In this lesson, you will:

-   Create and edit text files.
-   Search for files.
-   Perform various operations on files and directories, including viewing, copying, and removing them.
-   Process text files for easier analysis and use.
-   Manipulate file output through redirection, piping, etc.
