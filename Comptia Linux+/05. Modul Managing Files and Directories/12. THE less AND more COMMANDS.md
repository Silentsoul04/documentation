# THE less AND more COMMANDS

#### THE less AND more COMMANDS

Both the less and more commands are similar in that they enable you to display the contents of a file and page through those contents if they extend beyond the screen. The less command typically has additional features that more doesn't, but newer versions of more have added some of those features. While you're free to use either command, the less command is generally preferred.

**_NAVIGATION_**  
Navigation in less uses many of the same commands you've seen before, like the arrow keys to scroll line-by-line and **Page Up** and **Page Down** to scroll by page. You can also use / to search a file for a particular text string, and press **n** and **N** to move to the next or previous instance of the searched string, respectively. Press **q** to quit the program
