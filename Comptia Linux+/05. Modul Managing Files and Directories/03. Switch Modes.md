#### Execute Mode Commands

In command mode, when you enter the colon (:) operator, a small command prompt section appears at the bottom-left of the editor. This indicates that you are in execute mode and can run commands supported by Vim.

Some commands supported by Vim are listed in the following table.

Command | Function
---------- | --------
:w {file name} | Saves a file with a file name if it is being saved for the first time.
:q | Quits when no changes have been made after the last save.
:q! | Quits, ignoring the changes made.
:qa | Quits multiple files.
:wq | Saves the current file and quits.
:e! | Reverts to the last saved format without closing the file.
:!{any Linux command} | Executes the command and displays the result in the Vim interface.
:help | Opens Vim's built-in help documentation.
