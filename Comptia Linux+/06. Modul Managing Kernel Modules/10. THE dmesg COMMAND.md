# THE dmesg COMMAND

#### THE dmesg COMMAND

The dmesg ("display message" or "driver message") command is used to print any messages that have been sent to the kernel's message buffer during and after system boot. Device drivers send messages to the kernel indicating the status of modules and parameters that the drivers interface with. These drivers can also send diagnostic messages to the kernel in case they encounter errors. Other kernel components can also send messages to the buffer.

In addition to using the dmesg command, you can also access the message buffer from the /var/log/dmesg file. In either case, you can leverage dmesg to look for potential issues with kernel components or to validate that certain modules are being loaded.
