One of the defining features of Linux is that it is modular, enabling you to adjust low-level system configurations at boot and during operation. This provides you with a great deal of flexibility as far as adjusting how your system runs and what types of devices it can leverage. In this lesson, you'll explore more about the Linux kernel and some of its features, and then you'll customize the kernel to meet your unique business needs.

In this lesson, you will:

-   Identify the role and functions of the Linux kernel.
