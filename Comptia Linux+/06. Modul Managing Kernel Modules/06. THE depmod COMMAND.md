# THE depmod COMMAND

#### THE depmod COMMAND

In order for modprobe to accurately install dependent modules, it reads the modules.dep file to identify how modules are linked to one another. The depmod command is used to update this database of dependencies so that modprobe can function properly.

The depmod command searches the contents of `/lib/modules/<kernel version>/` for each module. A module may export a "symbol", indicating that it can provide a service to other modules. Other modules may call these exported symbols in their own code to leverage their capabilities. So, depmod builds the modules.dep file by aggregating all instances of symbols being exported and used.

> _Note: The_ **modules.dep** _file is located in the_ **/usr/lib/modules/** _directory._

**_SYNTAX_**  
The syntax of the `depmod` command is `depmod [options]`

**_MORE ON SYMBOLS_**  
Symbols provide a way for modules to call upon the functions or other programming objects of other modules. For example, module1 has a C function named foo() that performs some useful task. Another module, module2, wants to use foo() when it is linked to the kernel, rather than incorporate that routine in its own code. This is only possible if module1 explicitly exports foo() for external use. It does this by using EXPORT\_SYMBOL() or one of its variants on the function. The foo() function then becomes available as a symbol for any other module in the kernel to leverage.
