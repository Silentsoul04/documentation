# THE localectl COMMAND and Character Sets and Encoding

#### THE localectl COMMAND

The `localectl` command is used to view and configure the system locale and keyboard layout settings. A system's locale determines how it will represent various culture-specific elements, the most prominent of which is the language used in the interface. However, a locale can also determine factors such as how date and time are formatted, how monetary values are formatted, and more. Keyboard layouts can be configured independently of the locale and will determine how each physical key press is interpreted by the operating system. There are many keyboards with different physical layouts, so the system needs to be configured with the correct one or else the wrong character may be entered.

Like the `timedatectl` command, the `localectl` command offers various subcommands for managing the system locale and keyboard layout:

Subcommand | Used To
------- | -------
status | Show the current locale and keyboard layout. This is the same as issuing localectl by itself.
set-locale | Set the system locale to the locale provided.
list-locales | List all available locales on the system.
set-keymap | Set the keyboard layout to the provided layout.
list-keymaps | List all available keyboard layouts on the system.

**_SYNTAX_**  
The syntax of the `localectl` command is `localectl [options] [subcommand]`

**_localectl COMMAND OPTIONS_**  
The following table lists some of the options for the `localectl` command.

Option | Used To
------ | ------
\-H {remote host} | Execute the operation on the remote host specified by IP address or hostname.
\--no-ask-password | Prevent the user from being asked to authenticate when performing a privileged task.
\--no-pager | Prevent the output from being piped into a paging utility.
\--no-convert | Prevent a keymap change for the console from also being applied to the X display server, and vice versa.
  

#### Character Sets and Encoding

Character encoding is the process of converting text into bytes, and decoding is the process of converting bytes into text. Both of these concepts are important because text is much easier for humans to interact with, whereas computers process data in bytes. Therefore, there needs to be an intermediary process that enables both entities to interface with the same information.

In many systems, the default encoding is UTF-8 using the Unicode character set. For example, the capital letter C is associated with the positional number U+0043 in Unicode. UTF-8 encodes this number (43) in binary as 01000011. However, not all software uses this encoding. For example, some software might default to an older encoding standard like ASCII. If you've ever opened a text file and seen garbled and unreadable characters and symbols, then the text editor is probably assuming the wrong encoding.

In Linux, the locale settings determine what encoding scheme the system will use. The same general locale may have different encoding options. For example, de\_DE.utf8 and de\_DE.iso88591 both set Germany and the German language as the locale, but the former sets the encoding as UTF-8 and the latter sets an ASCII encoding standard.
