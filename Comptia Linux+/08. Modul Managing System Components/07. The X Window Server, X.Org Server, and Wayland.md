# The X Window System, X.Org Server, and

#### The X Window System

The **_X Window System_**, also known as **_X11_** or **_X_**, is a platform-independent display server and windowing system that was developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1984.

Like all display servers, the X server coordinates client input and application output to determine how to draw elements on the screen. The X server also communicates with a separate compositor. The compositor reads a memory buffer that each application writes to, then uses the information in this buffer to combine each individual application window on the screen so that multiple windows can appear at once. Whenever the X server receives an event (e.g., a button was clicked and must now be highlighted), it must inform the compositor so that it can re-composite the portion of the screen that is affected by the event.

#### X.Org Server

**_X.Org Server_** is the free and open source reference implementation of the X Window System for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Released in 2004, it quickly became the de facto display server on many Linux distributions. Prior to X.Org Server, the main implementation of X in Linux was XFree86, which eventually changed to a custom license that the free software community found GPL-incompatible. Thus, XFree86 was forked into X.Org Server.

#### Wayland

**_Wayland_** is both a display server and its reference implementation in Unix-like operating systems that is meant to improve upon and replace the X Window System. The primary difference between Wayland and X is that, in Wayland, the compositor is the server rather than a separate component. This enables clients to exchange events directly with the compositor, cutting out the X server as a middle man.

Wayland was first released in 2008, and although X.Org Server still dominates in Linux distributions, adoption of Wayland has been slowly increasing. For example, Fedora started using Wayland as its default display server starting with version 25, released in November of 2016.
