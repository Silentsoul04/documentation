# THE timedatectl COMMAND

#### THE timedatectl COMMAND

The timedatectl command is used to set system date and time information. It can take one of several subcommands, as detailed in the following table.

Subcommand | Used To
------ | ------
status |Show the current date and time information, including local time, universal time, RTC time, time zone, and more. This is the same as issuing timedatectl by itself.
set-time | Set the system's time to the time provided. The format should be as follows: 2018-10-31 15:03:16
set-timezone | Set the system's time zone to the time zone provided. The zone is in the format specified by the /usr/share/zoneinfo structure.
list-timezones | List all available time zones in the format specified by the /usr/share/zoneinfo structure.
set-ntp {0/1} | Enable or disable synchronization with a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server.

**_SYNTAX_**  
The syntax of the `timedatectl` command is `timedatectl [options] [subcommand]`

**_timedatectl COMMAND OPTIONS_**  
The following table lists some of the options for the `timedatectl` command.

Option | Used To
------ | ------
\-H {remote host} | Execute the operation on the remote host specified by IP address or hostname.
\--no-ask-password | Prevent the user from being asked to authenticate when performing a privileged task.
\--adjust-system-clock | Synchronize the local (system) clock based on the hardware clock when setting the hardware clock.
\-M {local container} | Execute the operation on a local container
  
**_CLOCK TYPES_**  
The `timedatectl` command exposes three different clocks that the system can use:

-   The local clock. This clock reflects the current time in the system's locale (i.e., the time zone).
-   The universal time. This clock reflects the time irrespective of the local time zone. It uses the international standard Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is the same as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
-   The hardware clock. As the name implies, this clock functions at the hardware level and keeps time even when the computer is powered off. An OS will derive the current time from this hardware clock. Any OS can also adjust the hardware clock, but it's usually a good idea to keep it at UTC. The hardware clock is also known as the real-time clock (RTC).

**_SETTING THE HARDWARE CLOCK_**  

Using `timedatectl` it is possible to set the hardware clock to be equal to the local time. However, this is not advisable because the RTC is not automatically updated. It is only updated by external facilities like other installed operating systems. Multiple OSs can adjust the RTC for daylight savings time (DST), causing an over-correction.
