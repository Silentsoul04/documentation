# THE date COMMAND

#### THE date COMMAND

The date command is used to print the date in a specified format. The date command will print the date based on the `/etc/localtime` file. By default, it will print the date in the following format:

`<day of week> <month> <day> <24 hour time ##:##:##> <time zone> <year>

Wed Oct 31 15:03:16 GMT 2018` 

You can also format the time using a number of different formatting options. You initialize the formatting options with a plus sign (+), and each option is prefaced with a percent sign (%). For example, to retrieve the week number (out of 52 weeks a year), you'd enter date +%V

You can also use the date command to change the system's date by including the -s option with a provided argument.
