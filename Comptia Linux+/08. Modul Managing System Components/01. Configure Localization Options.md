Before users can get comfortable working in the Linux environment, they may need to have the system localized to their specific region, culture, or preferences. In this topic, you'll configure localization options for users who need them.

#### Localization

In the world of operating systems, **_localization_** is the process of adapting system components for use within a distinct culture, other than the culture that the system was originally designed for. In a practical sense, this usually means translating interface components into specific languages; converting measurements into the system used in a specific region; configuring the keyboard layout that the user works with; setting the date and time attributes of a specific location; and more.

Localizing a Linux system is important for organizations that provide Linux services to personnel and customers all over the world. An administrator in Japan will likely be more comfortable working on a Linux server if that server is localized to use the Japanese language, rather than English. Working with the local time and with a compatible keyboard will also enhance the user experience for international users.

#### THE /usr/share/zoneinfo/ DIRECTORY

The `/usr/share/zoneinfo/` directory is a container for all of the regional time zones that you can configure the system to use. Subdirectories in this container usually organize languages by region; for example, the Africa subdirectory includes time zone files for specific countries or cities within the continent.

The individual files are not raw text files, but are special files used by the system. One way to change the system's time zone is by creating a symbolic link to one of these individual time zone files to the `/etc/localtime` file.

#### THE /etc/timezone FILE

In some Debian-based distros, /etc/timezone can be used to view the time zone. This text file lists the time zone by the region structure you'd see in the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory. For example, the file might include the text Europe/Berlin to indicate that the system is using the zone that this city is in.
