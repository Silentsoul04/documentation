# Configure GUIs

The CLI is not the only interface that Linux is capable of providing to the user. In some cases, users will want to work with a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more visual experience. So, in this topic, you'll configure multiple GUIs to help certain users be more productive and access features that aren't available in a non-visual CLI.

#### GUIs

A **_graphical user interface (GUI)_** enables users to interact with a system or application through visual design elements rather than pure text as in a command-line interface (CLI). In Linux, a GUI provides similar functionality to the GUIs of other operating systems like Windows and macOS. Users can select icons that represent files, folders, and programs to open or modify them; configure settings through menus; interact with applications through a windowed interface; and work from a desktop environment.

As you've seen, GUIs in Linux are optional and are commonly used in workstation or other non-server roles. GUIs add an extra layer of performance overhead, especially since drawing visual elements consumes much more processing power and memory than simple text. So, they are less commonly used on servers where performance is paramount. Still, this is not universally true, as many administrators prefer to work in a GUI environment, or at least have access to one even if they spend most of their time entering commands. GUIs can emulate a CLI that you enter commands into, so you're not limited to using the visual interface.

#### Display Servers

A **_display server_** is the component of a GUI that constructs and manages the windowing system and other visual elements that can be drawn on the screen. Display servers accept client input requests and send them to appropriate kernel modules for processing. Likewise, they also manage the process of receiving requests from an application to display output to the client.

As the name implies, display servers manage communications over a specific network-aware protocol. This enables remote clients to access GUI elements of a Linux system, like specific windows. However, the server can still provide its services to local clients.

Linux supports several different display servers. Two of the most prominent are implemented in the X Window System and Wayland.
