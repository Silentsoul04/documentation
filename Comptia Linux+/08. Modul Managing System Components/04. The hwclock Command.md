# THE hwclock COMMAND

#### THE hwclock COMMAND

The `hwclock` command enables you to view and set the hardware clock. As mentioned before, it is strongly recommended that you keep the hardware clock aligned with UTC to prevent over-correction by other operating systems.

You can also use the `hwclock` command to adjust the systematic drift. The **_systematic drift_** is the predictable amount of time that the hardware clock gains or loses each day, making it inaccurate and throwing it out of alignment with the system clock. The `/etc/adjtime` file records information about when and by how much the hardware clock is changed. The hwclock command can then consult this file to identify the drift value, which it can use to correct the clock's time.

**_SYNTAX_**  
The syntax of the `hwclock` command is `hwclock [function] [options]`
