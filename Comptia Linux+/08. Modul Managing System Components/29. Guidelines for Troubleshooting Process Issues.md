Use the following guidelines when troubleshooting process issues.

**_TROUBLESHOOT PROCESS ISSUES_**  
When troubleshooting process issues:

-   Gather information about a process, including its process ID (PID) and state.
-   Use `ps` to print information on all running processes, including CPU usage. For example, a process consuming over 50% of the CPU may cause performance issues, and is worth investigating further.
-   Use `top` to retrieve a dynamic and interactive list of all running processes.
-   Use `systemd-analyze` blame to determine what startup processes are slowing down boot operations.
-   Use `lsof` to identify which processes have open files.
-   Use `nice` and `renice` to prioritize certain processes over others.
-   Use `fg` and `bg` to manage foreground and background processes.
-   Use `nohup` to keep a command running even after logging off.
-   Use `kill` and its associated commands to terminate problem processes.
