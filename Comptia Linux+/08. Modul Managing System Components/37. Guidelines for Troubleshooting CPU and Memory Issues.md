-   Use sar to see what component is causing heavy load on the CPU and when.
-   Identify key information about memory usage using the /proc/meminfo file.
-   Use free to more easily analyze memory usage information.
-   Use vmstat to retrieve more information on both CPU and memory usage.
-   Consider tweaking the OOM killer to spare or sacrifice specific processes when low on memory.
-   Consider creating more swap space if adding physical memory is not feasible.
