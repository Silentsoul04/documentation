# Configure Account Profiles

In many cases, individual users will have their own preferences or unique needs when it comes to working in a Linux environment. So, you'll configure users' profiles to ensure they each have customized environments to work in.

#### **User Profiles**

Individual users have personal habits and preferences for their Linux work environment, and so a variety of profile file configurations are available to help them customize their experience. These customizations are referred to as profiles. An initial profile is created when the user account is created. There are many files and directories from which information is initially pulled to create a standard profile.

#### **THE .bashrc FILE**

The .bashrc file enables customization of the user's own environment. The file is stored in a user's home directory. Because the .bashrc file is unique to each user, it can be configured to a user's own specific needs or preferences.

A good example of the use of the .bashrc file is the use of aliases. Users can specify their own abbreviated commands without impacting the experience of any other user on the system. Another common configuration within .bashrc is environment variables. Users can also use the file to customize the command prompt to provide the information they want.

**_EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS_**  
Other than creating aliases, the .bashrc file is often configured to set default directory and file permissions for the user. Also, the default command prompt can be altered to provide more information. Most distributions place the user name, system hostname, and current directory in the prompt, but that can be changed.
