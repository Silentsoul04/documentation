# 	THE passwd COMMAND

#### THE passwd COMMAND

The passwd command is used by root to set or reset a password for any user. A user can use the passwd command themselves to reset their own password. It is also used to set the initial password for a user after creating the account with the useradd command.

> _Note: The screen will not show any output when a user is setting a password. Some users will mistake this for a problem, but it is actually Linux hiding the number of characters being used in the password._

**SYNTAX**  
The syntax of the passwd command is passwd \[user name\] where \[user name\] can be used by root to set a specific user's password.

#### THE /etc/passwd FILE

The /etc/passwd file stores user account information. All accounts, default or user-specific, will be found in this file. It is common for administrators to reference this file to learn about specific user accounts on the system. Each account contains seven fields of information. Each field is separated by a colon. The fields are not necessarily all populated.

Field | Content
------ | ------
User name | The name the user logs into the system with.
Password | The password that is assigned to the user, usually represented as an x to indicate that the password is stored elsewhere.
User ID | The unique number that represents the user to the system.
Group ID | The unique number that indicates the user's primary group membership.
Comment | Typically represents the user's full name.
Home directory | The absolute path to the user's home directory.
Login shell | The path to the shell that is launched when the user logs in (usually /bin/bash).

  
**EDITING THE /etc/passwd FILE**  
The proper way to edit the /etc/passwd file is via the useradd, usermod, and userdel commands. Manual editing of the file may result in mistakes that render the system unusable
