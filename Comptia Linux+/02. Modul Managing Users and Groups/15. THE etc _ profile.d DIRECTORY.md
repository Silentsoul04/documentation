# THE /etc/profile.d/ DIRECTORY

#### **THE /etc/profile.d/ DIRECTORY**

The `/etc/profile.d/` directory serves as a storage location for scripts administrators may use to set additional system-wide variables. It is recommended you set the environment variables via scripts contained in `/etc/profile.d/` rather than editing the `/etc/profile` file directly.

#### **THE /etc/bashrc FILE**

The `/etc/bashrc` file provides system-wide Bash settings. This is a little different than `/etc/profile`, which is used for variables.
