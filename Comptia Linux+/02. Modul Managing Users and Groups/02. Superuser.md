# Superuser

#### **Superuser**

In Linux, the local administrator account is named root. The account is used to perform administrative functions like managing users, configuring devices, configuring network settings, etc. The system also runs services with root credentials. The system does not necessarily confirm with the root user potentially destructive commands. The authority to log on to the system with root credentials is usually associated with the knowledge of administrative functions.

The root account is also referred to as the superuser. The security best practice is to never log on to the system with administrative credentials, but rather to log on with a non-privileged account and elevate credentials when necessary.

#### **Principle of Least Privilege**

In information security, the _**principle of least privilege**_ states that users should be given no more authority on the system than they need to perform their job. If a user needs to be able to read but not write to a file, then give them only read. If a user needs to be able to restart the server but not reconfigure the server, then only give them privileges to restart. It is much easier to correct privilege issues by giving a little more access than it is to remove existing access. By giving the user the access they need to do their jobs and no more than that, the system will remain significantly more secure.

#### **THE su COMMAND**

As you have seen, it is a poor practice to log on to the server directly with root privileges. The better practice is to log on with a standard user account, then elevate your privileges to root as needed. One way of elevating privileges is to "substitute user" using the su command.

The su command, without an option, enables a user to switch their identity to that of another user, but it retains the original user's profile and variables. The switched user also remains in the home directory of the original user. Anyone using su except the root user will be challenged for the password of the user account they are switching to.

Using su with a hyphen following it enables a user to change users and launch a new shell under the context of that new user. This is a much better practice. Anyone using su â€“ except the root user will be challenged for the password of the user they are switching to. It is most common to switch to the root user, but any user can switch to any other user so long as they know the user's password.

**SYNTAX**

The syntax of the su command is su \[-\] \[user name\]

> _Note: Without a user name argument, the su - command will assume you mean to sign in as root._
