# THE .bash\_profile FILE

**THE .bash\_profile FILE**

The .bash\_profile file provides shell configuration for the initial login environment. This differs from the .bashrc file, which provides settings for all of the user's interactive shells. The .bash\_profile file is only read with the first login, while the .bashrc is read with all subsequent logins.

A default .bash\_profile can be provided to new users via the /etc/skel directory.

#### **Global User Profiles**

An administrator may find it desirable to define system-wide settings or to configure initial settings for users. The files and directories that follow give the administrator the flexibility to make a variety of configurations, which may be later customized by a user for their own specific needs.

#### **THE /etc/skel/ DIRECTORY**

The contents of the /etc/skel/ directory are automatically copied into the home directories of new users. Administrators can pre-populate the /etc/skel/ directory with configuration files or other content. When the useradd command is run, the /etc/skel/ directory's contents are copied to the new user's home directory, immediately giving them the configurations they might need.

Note that files added to the /etc/skel/ directory after a user account is created will not be copied to the home directories of existing users.

#### **THE /etc/profile FILE**

The /etc/profile file provides system-wide environment variables. This may be more effective for administrators to configure if there are settings that apply to all users.

During the initial login process for a user, the system reads the `/etc/profile` file first for Bash shell configurations, and then any user-specific Bash customizations are pulled from the `.profile` file located in the user's home directory. The .profile file runs each time a new shell is started, whereas `/etc/profile` is only run at login. This approach enables administrators to define global shell settings, but still allow user-specific customizations.

> _Note: The global file is `/etc/profile` (without the "dot" as the first character of the file name), while the user-specific file is `.profile`, indicating that the file is hidden._

**EXAMPLE**  
An example of a `.profile` is as follows:

`PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:/scripts
MAIL=/var/mail/$LOGNAME
EDITOR=emacs
export PATH MAIL EDITOR` 

The first line defines the paths of executable files; the second line defines the path for where incoming email messages are stored; and the third line defines the default text editor. The last line actually ensures these variables are implemented in the environment.
