# THE /etc/shadow FILE

#### THE /etc/shadow FILE

The /etc/passwd file was once used to store the cryptographically hashed version of passwords. That file is world-readable, however, meaning that one user could see the hashed version of another user's password. By entering that hashed password in a password cracking utility, a user could discover another user's password.

The /etc/shadow file is the modern storage location for hashed passwords, as well as additional account information. This additional information includes password requirements and expiration information. Only root has access to the content of the /etc/shadow file, preventing users from attempting to crack each other's passwords.

#### THE chage COMMAND

The chage or "change age" command is used to control password expiration, expiration warnings, inactive days, and other information for existing accounts. Changes to a security policy or potential security breach may prompt the administrator to alter the password settings for existing accounts. These changes are reflected in the /etc/shadow file.

Option | Description | Example
------- | ------- | -------
\-E | Sets the account to expire at the specified date and time. | `chage -E 2022/12/31 user1`
\-l | Lists password aging information. | `chage -l user1`
\-M | Sets the maximum days the password is valid for. | `chage -M 90 user1`
\-m | Sets the minimum days until the password can be changed. | `chage -m 1 user1`
\-W | Sets number of days before expiration that user will be warned to change their password. | `chage -W 5 user1`


**SYNTAX**  
The syntax of the chage command is chage \[options\] {user name}
