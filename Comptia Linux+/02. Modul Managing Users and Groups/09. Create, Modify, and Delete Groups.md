# Create, Modify, and Delete Groups

> _2.2 Given a scenario, manage users and groups._

In order to grant access to users in a more efficient manner, you'll create groups for users to be part of. You'll also modify and delete those groups as necessary.

#### **Group Accounts**

_**Groups**_ associate user accounts that have similar security requirements. Groups simplify administrative tasks, allowing multiple users to be granted permissions to resources. Groups are represented on the system by a group ID number (GID). Users may be a member of more than one group.

#### **THE /etc/group FILE**

The /etc/group file is the storage location for groups. All groups, default or user-specific, will be found in this file. It is common for administrators to reference the /etc/group file to find information about the groups on the system. Each group contains four fields of information. Each field is separated by a colon. The fields are not necessarily all populated.

The proper way to edit the /etc/group file is with the groupadd, groupmod, and groupdel commands. Manually editing the file is not recommended, as a mistake could render the system unusable.

Field | Description 
-------- | ---------
Group name | The user-friendly name of the group.
Password | The password required to enter the group.
Group ID | The group ID by which the system references the group.
Group list | The list of all group members (empty by default).
