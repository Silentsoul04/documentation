# Query Users and Groups

> **EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED**

> _2.2 Given a scenario, manage users and groups._

After you've created and managed users and groups, you'll likely need to learn more about one or more accounts and their activity on the system. By querying users and groups, you can keep better track of how these accounts are being used.

#### Account Querying

Administrators and users may need to gather information about their identity on the system. There are many commands that will report user and group information. This information is useful for troubleshooting access problems or verifying what account the user is currently logged on with.

#### THE whoami COMMAND

The whoami command is used to display the user name with which you are currently logged in to the system. Sometimes, you may need to log in to a system and switch among different users, and you may not be sure with which user you are currently logged in. In such instances, you can use the whoami command to verify your current user name.

Many Linux distributions will show the user name of the currently logged in user at the command prompt. For the root user, the prompt will show a # character. For standard users, the prompt will show a $ character.
