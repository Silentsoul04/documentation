# THE visudo COMMAND

#### **THE visudo COMMAND**

While the /etc/sudoers file is a normal text file, it is essential not to directly edit it with a standard text editor like Vim or nano. The /etc/sudoers file controls access to all elevated privileges and a mistake in this file can render it impossible to gain root privileges on the server. Most distributions will set a default editor (usually Vim or nano) for /etc/sudoers. When using the visudo command, the system verifies the syntax of the /etc/sudoers file before committing changes, enabling the administrator an opportunity to correct mistakes before they become part of the running configuration.

#### THE wheel GROUP

The root system account is used for a great deal more than just administrative tasks. Many parts of the actual Linux operating system run under root credentials. Many distributions disable the actual root account for users and instead allow administrative functions based on membership in the wheel group.

Members of the wheel group exercise the administrative privileges of root with less potential for damaging the system. For example, members of the wheel group can use the sudo command to avoid having to sign in as the root user. You can use the visudo command to edit the privileges of the wheel group, if necessary. You can add users to the wheel group to give them privileges. Be very cautious about the membership of the wheel group.
