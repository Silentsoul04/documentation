# Kernel Panic

#### Kernel Panic

_**Kernel panic**_ is a mechanism by which the system detects there has been a fatal error and responds to it. A fatal error typically results in the system becoming unstable or totally unusable. Software that handles kernel panics will display an error message to the user and dump the current state of kernel memory to a storage device for later debugging. Depending on how the system is configured, the panic handler will either reboot the system automatically, or wait for the user to do so.

In Linux, kernel panic can happen for a number of reasons and at any point during operation, but it is usually experienced during the boot process. Common causes include the following:

-   The kernel itself is corrupted or otherwise improperly configured.
-   The systemd program is not executed during boot, leaving the system unusable.
-   The kernel cannot find or otherwise cannot mount the main root file system.
-   Malfunctioning or incompatible hardware is loaded into the kernel on boot.
