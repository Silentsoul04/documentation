Now that you're familiar with the purpose and role of a boot loader in the boot process, you can focus on configuring the primary Linux boot loader: GRUB 2.

#### GNU GRUB

The **_GNU GRand Unified Bootloader (GNU GRUB)_** is a boot loader developed by the GNU Project that became popular on Unix-like systems. It enables users to choose which operating system or kernel version to boot in a multi-platform environment. Although the original version of GRUB was the primary boot loader for Linux distributions, it had several limitations and was eventually phased out in favor of a newer version of GRUB. This original version is sometimes referred to as GRUB legacy.

#### GRUB 2 Improvements

GRUB 2 is more than simply a newer version of GRUB; it is a complete redesign and rewrite of the GRUB system. GRUB 2 offers administrators more control over the boot process, boot devices, and boot behavior. In addition, it comes with several improvements, including:

-   Support for non-x86 architecture platforms.
-   Support for live booting (booting an OS from storage media and running the OS entirely in memory, without installation).
-   Support for partition UUIDs.
-   Support for dynamically loading modules that extend GRUB's functionality.
-   Ability to configure the boot loader through scripts.
-   Rescue mode, which attempts to fix boot issues like corrupted or missing configurations.
-   Support for custom graphical boot menus and themes.

Because of these improvements, GRUB 2 has become the default boot loader on almost all modern Linux distributions.
