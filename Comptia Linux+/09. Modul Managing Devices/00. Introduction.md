# Modul Managing Devices

The next component category you can configure is devices. At some point, physical hardware is required to interface with the operating system, even if you're not co-located with the system itself. You must therefore ensure that any hardware devices connected to the system are recognizable to the system and properly configured. So, in this lesson, you'll manage several different kinds of devices.

In this lesson, you will:

-   Identify the different types of devices that support the Linux OS.
-   Configure devices.
-   Monitor devices.
-   Troubleshoot various issues having to do with hardware devices.
