# Inodes

#### Inodes

An _index node (inode)_ is an object that stores metadata about a file or directory on a file system. This metadata can include time-based values like when a file was created and last modified; permission and ownership information; the block locations of a file's data on a storage device; and other miscellaneous information.

Each inode on a file system is identified by a unique integer called an inode number. Whenever the system or an application tries to access a file, it searches for the appropriate inode number in a data structure called an inode table. The inode table maps an inode number to its corresponding file or directory name.

Some file systems set a maximum number of inodes when that file system is created, usually by considering the overall size of the file system. The total number of files and directories cannot exceed this inode maximum. However, some file system types, like XFS, use a dynamic inode allocation system that scales as a percentage of the file system's capacity. In other words, these file systems do not set a strict inode limit.

> _Note: You can use the `ls -i` command to list the inode numbers for files and directories._

#### Journaling

_Journaling_ is a method by which a file system records changes that have not yet been made to the file system itself in an object called a journal. This enables the file system to quickly recover after an unexpected interruption, such as a system crash, because the system can reference pending changes in the journal to resume where it had left off.

The journaling process involves the following phases:

1.  The journal describes all the changes that must be made to the drive.
2.  A background process makes each change as and when it is entered in the journal.
3.  If the system shuts down, pending changes are performed when it is rebooted.
4.  Incomplete entries in the journal are discarded.
