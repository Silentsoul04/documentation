After formatting your partitions and logical volumes with file systems, you need to actually make it possible for users and the system to work with the file systems. So, in this topic, you'll make these file systems available by mounting them.

#### Mount Points

A _mount point_ is an access point to information stored on a local or remote storage device. The mount point is typically an empty directory on which a file system is loaded, or mounted, to make the file system accessible to users. If the directory already has content, the content becomes invisible to the users until the mounted file system is unmounted.

> _Note: You can use the_ `fstab` _file to list the file system to be mounted and unmounted when the Linux system boots and shuts down, respectively._

#### THE mount COMMAND

The mount command loads a file system to a specified directory so that it can be accessible to users and applications. You must specify the device to mount as well as the desired mount point.
