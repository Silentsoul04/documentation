# Partitions

#### Partitions

A partition is a section of the storage drive that logically acts as a separate drive. Partitions enable you to convert a large drive to smaller manageable chunks, leading to better organization of information. A partition must be formatted and assigned a file system before data can be stored on it.

Partitions are identified using a partition table, which is stored in one or more areas of the drive. The size of each partition can vary but cannot exceed the total free space of the storage drive.

Most operating systems, including Linux, use drive partitions. Data of different types can be stored in separate locations on the drive, such as separating system files from user-accessible files.

#### Types of Partitions

There are three types of partitions: primary, extended, and logical. The functionality of the storage drive depends on the types of partitions on it.

Each partition has a set of specific features. The three types of partitions are described in the table.

Partition Type

Description

Primary

A partition that can contain one file system or logical drive, and is sometimes referred to as a volume. The swap file system and the boot partition are usually created in their own primary partitions.

Extended

An extended partition can contain several file systems, which are referred to as logical drives. There can be only one extended partition, which can be further subdivided. This partition type does not contain any data and has a separate partition table.

Logical

A part of a physical drive that has been partitioned and allocated as an independent unit and functions as a separate drive. A logical partition is created within an extended partition, and is therefore a subset of an extended partition. There is no restriction on the number of logical partitions, but it is advisable to limit it to 12 logical partitions per drive.

  

#### Swap Space

Swap space is a partition on the storage device that is used when the system runs out of physical memory. Linux pushes some of the unused files from RAM to the swap space to free up memory. Usually, the swap space equals twice the RAM capacity.
