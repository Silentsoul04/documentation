# The Home Directory

#### The Home Directory

The home directory contains a user's personal files or files that are otherwise specific to that user. The home directory is where you are placed when you log in to the system. In Linux, by default, every user except the root user is assigned a subdirectory in /home that corresponds to their user name. A user can create subdirectories and files within this directory.

The home directory of the root user is /root. This is not to be confused with the root directory (/), which is the top-most part of the file system hierarchy.

In many shells, including KornShell, C shell, and Bash, the tilde character (Ëœ) represents your home directory.

#### The Current Working Directory

The **_current working directory (CWD)_** is the location on the system that you are accessing at any point in time. For example, when you log in to a system, you are placed in your home directory. So, your current working directory is your home directory. The current working directory is represented in shorthand as a single period (.).

Remember, you can enter pwd to identify your current working directory.

#### The Parent Directory

The **_parent directory_** is one level above your current working directory. All directories, except the root directory, have a parent directory. You can use the double period notation (..) to switch to the parent directory.

#### Paths

A **_path_** specifies a location in the file system. It begins with the root directory, the directory at the top of the directory tree, and ends with the directory or file you want to access. Thus far, you've worked with paths in order to access various files and directories.

You can refer to a particular file by providing a path to the specific directory that contains the file. For example, the home directory `jsmith` contains a subdirectory, work, which contains a file named mywork. To refer to that file, use the following path name: `/home/jsmith/work/mywork`. Notice that the forward slash (/) character is used to separate items in the path. The slash that precedes home represents the root directory, from which the path to the file mywork begins.
