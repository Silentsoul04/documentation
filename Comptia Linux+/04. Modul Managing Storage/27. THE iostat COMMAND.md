# THE iostat COMMAND

#### THE iostat COMMAND

The iostat utility generates reports on CPU and device usage. For storage, it provides input and output statistics for block devices and partitions. Using the -d option to specify device information only, the iostat command lists the following statistics for each storage device:

-   Transfers (I/O requests) per second (`tps`).
-   Number of blocks read per second (`kB_read/s`).
-   Number of blocks written per second (`kB_wrtn/s`).
-   The total number of blocks read (`kB_read`).
-   The total number of blocks written (`kB_wrtn`).

You can use this report to monitor how a storage drive is being used and to identify any potential bottlenecks. For example, a faulty drive might have lower reads and/or writes per second than expected. You can also use the report to help you decide how to best distribute I/O load between the available devices.
