Linux provides you with many tools for modifying file systems after applying them to storage devices. In this topic, you'll perform various tasks to ensure your file systems are fulfilling your business needs.

**_THE /proc/mounts FILE_**  

The `/proc/mounts` file lists the status of all currently mounted file systems in a format similar to `fstab`: the system's name, mount point, file system type, etc. It is actually not a real file, but part of the virtual file system that represents the status of mounted objects as reported by the Linux kernel. Typically you'd read this "file" using a command like cat in order to get the details you're looking for.

Note that `/proc/mounts` lists all file systems, not just those on storage drives and partitions. It may not be the most readable tool to use in case you're only looking for drive information.

**_THE mtab FILE_**  
The `/etc/mtab`file is very similar to the `/proc/mounts` file in that it reports the status of currently mounted file systems. However, `/proc/mounts` is typically more accurate and includes more up-to-date information about the file systems.

**_THE /proc/partitions FILE_**  
The /proc/partitions file contains information about each partition that is currently attached to the system. Like /proc/mounts, it is not a real file but part of the virtual file system. The format of /proc/partitions contains columns, and each column is as follows:

-   **major**—Represents the class of device so that it can be mapped to an appropriate driver.
-   **minor**—Separates partitions into physical devices. This corresponds to the number at the end of the partition's name.
-   **#blocks**—How many physical blocks the partition takes up.
-   **name**—The name of the partition.
