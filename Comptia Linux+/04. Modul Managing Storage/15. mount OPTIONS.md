noexec | Prevent binaries in a file system from being executed.
ro | Mount a file system as read-only.

**_BINARIES_**  
A binary is source code that is compiled into an executable program, or otherwise assembled so that it is readable by the computer system. In addition, binaries can be pictures, word processing files, or spreadsheet files.

#### THE umount COMMAND

After using the mounted file system, it can be disassociated from the directory by unloading, or unmounting, the file system using the umount command. In order to unmount a file system, it must not be in useâ€”for example, if a file on that file system is currently open in some application.

**_SYNTAX_**  
The syntax of the umount command is `umount [options] {mount point}`

\-R | Recursively unmount the specified directory mount points.
\-t {fs type} | Unmount only the file system types specified.
\-O {mount options} | Unmount only the file systems that are mounted with the specified options in the /etc/fstab file.
