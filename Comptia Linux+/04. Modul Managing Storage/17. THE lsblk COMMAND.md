# THE lsblk COMMAND

#### THE lsblk COMMAND

The lsblk command displays information about all block storage devices that are currently available on the system. The output is displayed in a tree-like format with each physical device at the top of the tree and each partition or logical volume branching off from that device. The information displayed includes names, major and minor numbers, size, device type, and mount point.

#### THE blkid COMMAND

The blkid command offers similar functionality to `lsblk`, but it simply prints each block device in a flat format and includes some additional information like device/partition UUID and file system type. However, it is preferable to use `lsblk -f` if you want this additional information.

The syntax of the blkid command is `blkid [options] [device name]`

#### ext TOOLS

When it comes to managing file systems and partitions, some tools are designed to only work with specific file system types. Some can work with multiple types, but are much better suited to one or a few specific types. When it comes to ext file systems, there are several tools that you can use on essentially any generation of the ext type (i.e., ext2/3/4).

Some of the most common and useful tools for managing ext file systems include:

-   `e2fsck`
-   `resize2fs`
-   `tune2fs`
-   `dumpe2fs`
