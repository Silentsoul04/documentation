# Storage Space Tracking

#### Storage Space Tracking

The df and du commands facilitate storage space tracking. The df command ("disk free") enables you to view the device's free space, file system, total size, space used, percentage value of space used, and mount point. The du command ("disk usage") displays how a device is used, including the size of directory trees and files within it. It also enables you to track space hogs, which are directories and files that consume large amounts of space on the storage drive. These are your go-to commands to confirm excessive storage space consumption that might be causing system issues.

> _Note: The `-h` option is useful because it makes the output more human-friendly (i.e., presenting size in units like GB rather than bytes)._ ![](store.png)

**_SYNTAX_**  
The syntax of the `du` and `df` commands is `du/df [options] [object names]`

#### I/O Scheduling

**_I/O scheduling_** is the process by which the operating system determines the order of input and output operations as they pertain to block storage devices. Scheduling is important because, compared to CPU and memory operations, block storage operations are relatively slow—especially in disk-based technology like hard disk drives. The Linux kernel therefore doesn't just begin writing or reading to a drive in the order that such requests are submitted; instead, it prioritizes certain requests over others in order to minimize performance issues that can come with I/O tasks.

Although the kernel handles scheduling, you can actually configure the scheduler with different behavior types. Some behaviors are more appropriate than others in certain situations, and you may find that setting a new type increases read/write speeds. Changing the scheduler is typically done during the troubleshooting process in order to finely tune storage performance when every bit of that performance matters.

#### Scheduler Types

The following table describes some of the different schedulers that are available to modern Linux kernel versions.

Type | Description
------- | -------
deadline | This scheduler performs sorting of I/O operations using three queues: a standard pending request queue, a read first in first out (FIFO) queue, and a write FIFO queue; the latter two of which are sorted by submission time and have expiration values.When a request is submitted, it is sorted into the standard queue, and placed at the end of its appropriate FIFO queue. When the request at the top of the FIFO queue becomes older than the queue's expiration, the scheduler stops working with the standard queue and starts servicing requests from the top of the FIFO queue—in other words, it handles the oldest requests. This ensures that the scheduler doesn't "starve" a request for too long. This makes it ideal for certain workloads like multi-threaded workloads.
cfq | This refers to the Complete Fair Queuing (CFQ) scheduler. In this scheduler, each process is given its own queue and each queue has an interval by which it is accessed, or its time slice. The scheduler uses a round-robin system to access each queue and services requests from these queues until either their time slices or requests are exhausted.  When this happens, the CFQ waits 10 milliseconds until it sees a new request on the queue, and if it doesn't, it moves on to another queue. Like the deadline scheduler, this helps to minimize request starvation. Its advantage is that it services processes fairly, and provides good performance in most workload situations. It is also the default scheduler for modern versions of the Linux kernel.
noop | This is the simplest scheduler and does not sort I/O requests, but merely merges them. This can be ideal in situations where the device or its storage controller performs its own sorting operations. It can also benefit devices that don't have mechanical components requiring seek time, like SSDs and USB flash drives, because this scheduler doesn't expend much effort in reducing seek time. However, the previous two schedulers are preferred in most other situations.

  
**_SETTING THE SCHEDULER_**  
You can set the scheduler to use on a particular device by modifying the scheduler file located at `/sys/block/<device name>/queue/scheduler`

Setting the scheduler is as simple as echoing the desired option to this file, as in:

```Shell
echo noop > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
``` 

Note that this sets the scheduler for runtime only; the setting will revert upon reboot. To persist your changes, you must modify the system's boot loader configuration.
