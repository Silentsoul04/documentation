# THE fsck COMMAND

#### THE fsck COMMAND

The fsck command is used to check the integrity of a file system. **_File system integrity_** refers to the correctness and validity of a file system. Most systems automatically run the fsck command at boot time so that errors, if any, are detected and corrected before the system is used. File system errors are usually caused by power failures, hardware failures, or improper shutdown of the system.

You should unmount the file system before scanning it with `fsck` to prevent damage to the file system.

> _Note: The `fsck`command is essentially a front-end that calls the appropriate tool for the type of file system you're working with. For ext file systems, it will call the `e2fsck` tool. ![](fsck.png)_

**_SYNTAX_**  
The syntax of the `fsck` command is `fsck [options] {device/file system name}`

**_REPAIR FILE SYSTEMS_**  
You can use the `fsck -r {device/file system name}` command to repair a file system. The command will prompt you to confirm your actions. If you are simultaneously checking multiple file systems, you should not use this option because it allows you to repair only a single file system at a time.

#### THE resize2fs COMMAND

The `resize2fs` command is used to enlarge or shrink an ext2/3/4 file system on a device. You can enlarge a mounted file system, but you must unmount the file system before you can shrink it. You can specify the desired size of the file system in order to either enlarge or shrink it. If you don't specify a size, the file system will be resized to the same size as the partition.

It's important to note that resize2fs does not resize partitions, only the file system. You must use a command like `fdisk` or an LVM tool to expand the size of the partition/volume first in order to then enlarge the file system.

**_SYNTAX_**  
The syntax of the `resize2fs` command is `resize2fs [options] {device/file system name} [desired size]`
