# THE partprobe COMMAND

#### THE partprobe COMMAND

The partprobe command is used to update the kernel with changes in the partition table. The command first checks the partition table, and if there are any changes, it automatically updates the kernel with the changes.

After creating a partition with fdisk, you cannot add a file system to that partition unless the kernel can read it from the partition table. You might receive an error like "Re-reading the partition table failed" during the fdisk operation. Rebooting the machine updates the table, or you can issue partprobe instead to update the table without a reboot.

The partprobe command comes packaged with the GNU parted utility.
