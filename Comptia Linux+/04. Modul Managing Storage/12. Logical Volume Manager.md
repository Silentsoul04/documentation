# Logical Volume Manager

#### Logical Volume Manager

One major application of the device mapper is the _Logical Volume Manager (LVM)_. LVM maps whole physical devices and partitions (`e.g., /dev/sda1, /dev/sdb2, etc.`) into one or more virtual containers called volume groups. Within these volume groups are one or more logical volumes. Ultimately, the logical volumes become the storage devices that the system, user, and applications work with.

Many distributions support LVM, and several actually place the root file system on logical volumes during installation.

#### LVM Advantages

Compared to traditional physical partition management, LVM provides the following benefits:

-   You can dynamically create, delete, and resize volumes without having to reboot the system.
-   Day-to-day management of volumes is easier once everything is set up.
-   You can map multiple logical volumes across multiple physical devices.
-   A logical volume can exceed the size of any one physical device, as long as it doesn't exceed the total size of devices in the volume group.
-   You can create virtual snapshots of each logical volume so you can quickly and easily revert a volume to a specific state.

One potential downside to LVM is that the initial setup can be somewhat complex.

#### THE /dev/mapper/ DIRECTORY

The `/dev/mapper/` directory contains all of the logical volumes on the system that are managed by LVM. Devices in this directory are typically formatted as:

`/dev/mapper/<volume group name>-<logical volume name>` 

In some cases, this directory may just include links to the actual logical volume location.
