# Storage Quotas

#### Storage Quotas

A **_storage quota_** is the storage space that is allotted to a user for file storage on a computer. Storage quotas are configured on a per-user basis. File systems that implement storage quotas can have a soft limit, a grace period, and a hard limit. Once a user exceeds the soft limit, they are placed in the grace period for a default of seven days. The user is allowed to exceed this soft limit within this grace period, but cannot exceed the hard limit maximum. If the user goes below the soft limit, the timer resets. If the user still exceeds the soft limit when the timer expires, the soft limit is automatically imposed as a hard limit, and the user will be unable to use any additional storage.

Storage quotas are a good measure to prevent or respond to issues that arise due to excessive storage use. You can use these quotas to ensure that users are not consuming all of a drive's space and leaving none for other users or the system.

#### Quota Management Commands

Quota management is the effective allotment and monitoring of quotas for all users. Linux has various commands that help ease the job of quota management for the system administrator.

> _Note: You should assign quotas in such a way that users are able to maximize the use of storage resources without data overflow._

Command | Used To
------ | -------
quotacheck -cug {mount point} | Create quota database files for a file system and check for user and group quotas.
edquota -u {user name} | Edit quotas for a specific user.
edquota -g {group name} | Edit quotas for a specific group.
setquota -u {user name} | Set quotas for a specific user.
setquota -g {group name} | Set quotas for a specific group.

  

**_QUOTA ACTIVATION_**  
Before you can use these commands, you must actually activate user and/or group quotas on the file system. You can do this by editing the `fstab` file to add the options `usrquota` and `grpquota` to the relevant file system.

**_XFS QUOTAS_**  
You can use the `xfs_quota` utility to configure quotas on XFS file systems. This utility can run in both interactive and non-interactive mode. When run non-interactively, use the -c option to specify which commands to run, and the -x option to enable expert mode, which is required for most administrative tasks. Tasks include setting limits on writing blocks and inodes, setting warning limits, generating quota reports, and more.

#### Quota Reports

Quota reports are created by the system so you can view storage space usage by each user. These reports enable you to check which user is taking up maximum disk space. They can also help you troubleshoot issues with quotas themselvesâ€”for example, quotas that are either too restrictive or too permissive.

A quota report contains the following details:

-   The name of the user/group.
-   The total number of blocks (in kilobytes) that are being used by the user/group on a file system.
-   The user's/group's storage soft limit.
-   The user's/group's storage hard limit.
-   The grace period.
-   The total number of inodes that have been used on a file system by the user/group.
-   The soft limit on inodes.
-   The hard limit on inodes. ![](quota.png) 

	**_REPORT GENERATION COMMANDS_**  
	Several commands are available for the generation of effective quota reports.
	
Command | Used To
---------- | ----------
repquota -a | Display the reports for all file systems indicated as read-write with quotas in the mtab file.
repquota -u {user name} | Display the quota report for a particular user.
quota -uv {user name} | Display the quota report for a particular user with verbose output.
warnquota -u | Check if users are not exceeding the allotted quota limit.
warnquota -g | Check if groups are not exceeding the allotted quota limit.
