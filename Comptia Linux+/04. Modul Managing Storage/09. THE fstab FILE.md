# THE fstab FILE

#### THE fstab FILE

The fstab file is a configuration file that stores information about storage devices and partitions and where and how the partitions should be mounted. The fstab file is located in the /etc directory. It is read by the system at boot time and can be edited only by a root user. The fstab file consists of a number of lines, one for each file system.

Each line in an fstab file has six fields that are separated by spaces or tabs.

Field | Description
---- | ----
Device or partition name | Specifies the name of the device or file system to mount.
Default mount point | Indicates where the file system is to be mounted.
File system type | Specifies the type of file system used by the device or partition.
Mount options | Specifies a set of comma-separated options that will be activated when the file system is mounted.
dumpoptions | Indicates if the dump utility should back up the file system. Usually, zero is specified as the dump option to indicate that dump can ignore the file system.
fsckoptions | Specifies the order in which the fsck utility should check file systems.

**_THE crypttab FILE_**  
The `/etc/crypttab` file performs a similar function to the `fstab` file, but its purpose is to store information about encrypted devices and partitions that must be unlocked and mounted on system boot. Its format is similar to fstab, but includes an optional password field for unlocking the encrypted device.

#### The Storage Device Setup Process

Putting several of the previous tools together, the overall process of setting up a storage device for use on Linux is as follows:

1.  Partition the storage device using a tool like fdisk or parted
2.  Format the partition with a file system using the mkfs tool.
3.  Add the formatted partition to the fstab file so that it is configured by the system on boot.
