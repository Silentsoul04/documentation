# Absolute vs. Relative Paths

#### Absolute vs. Relative Paths

Paths are of two typesâ€”absolute and relative. An absolute path refers to the specific location irrespective of the current working directory or combined paths. These paths are usually written with reference to the root directory, and therefore start with a forward slash. Paths that do not begin with a forward slash are called relative paths. A relative path is the path relative to the current working directory; therefore, the full absolute path need not be included. These paths can contain the period (.) and double period (..), which are indications for the current and parent directories.

**_EXAMPLES_**  
The following examples show accessing the same location using absolute and relative paths, respectively.

Using an absolute path:

```Shell
cd /usr/bin
``` 

Using a relative path when the CWD is /usr/:

```Shell
cd bin
``` 

#### File System Navigation Commands

The following table is a review of file navigation commands you've seen thus far.

Command | Used To
----- | ----
cd | Traverse the directory structure using absolute or relative paths to change your current working directory.
ls | List the files and directories in the current working directory or the relative/absolute path you specify. In long listing format (\-l), the first bit indicates the type of file.
pwd | Print the current working directory to the console.
