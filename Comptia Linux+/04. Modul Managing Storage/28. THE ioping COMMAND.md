# THE ioping COMMAND

#### THE ioping COMMAND

The ioping command generates a report of device I/O latency in real-time. It will continuously "ping" the specified device with requests and print information about each request at the command-line. By default, this information tracks how long it took an I/O request to finish. Aside from specifying a device to test, you can also specify a path name to test whatever device is associated with that path.

Consider using ioping to troubleshoot latency issues with storage devices, especially if you believe your read and/or write speeds are slower than they should be.

> _Note: This is similar to the standard `ping` command, which tests network latency._ ![](ioping.png) **_SYNTAX_**  
> The syntax of the `ioping` command is `ioping [options] {file/directory/device name}`

-------- | -------
\-c {count} | Specify the number of I/O requests to perform before stopping.
\-i {time} | Set the time (interval) between I/O requests.
\-t {time} | Set the minimum valid request time. Requests faster than this are ignored.
\-T {time} | Set the maximum valid request time. Requests slower than this are ignored.
\-s {size} | Set the size of requests.
