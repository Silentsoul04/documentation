# Modul Managing Storage

Aside from managing user access to your Linux systems, one of the most foundational tasks is the management of data storage. There are many ways to divide, format, and otherwise organize how your data is stored, and Linux gives you many tools for doing so. Using these tools, you will ultimately make it easier for authorized users to work with data.

In this lesson, you will:

-   Create drive partitions.
-   Manage volumes using the Logical Volume Manager (LVM).
-   Mount Linux file systems.
-   Manage Linux file systems.
-   Navigate the directory structure defined in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
-   Troubleshoot storage issues.
