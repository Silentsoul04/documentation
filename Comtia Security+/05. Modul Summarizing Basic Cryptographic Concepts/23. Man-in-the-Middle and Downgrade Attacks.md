# Man-in-the-Middle and Downgrade Attacks

#### MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE AND DOWNGRADE ATTACKS

Some attacks depend on capturing the communications between two parties. They do not break the cryptographic system but exploit vulnerabilities in the way it is used. A _man-in-the-middle (MITM)_ attack is typically focused on public key cryptography.

1.  Mallory eavesdrops the channel between Alice and Bob and waits for Alice to request Bob's public key.
2.  Mallory intercepts the communication, retaining Bob's public key, and sends his own public key to Alice.
3.  Alice uses Mallory's key to encrypt a message and sends it to Bob.
4.  Mallory intercepts the message and decrypts it using his private key.
5.  Mallory then encrypts a message (possibly changing it) with Bob's public key and sends it to Bob, leaving Alice and Bob oblivious to the fact that their communications have been compromised.

This attack is prevented by using secure authentication of public keys, such as associating the keys with certificates. This should ensure that Alice rejects Mallory's public key.

A **downgrade attack** can be used to facilitate a man-in-the-middle attack by requesting that the server use a lower specification protocol with weaker ciphers and key lengths. For example, rather than use TLS 1.3, as the server might prefer, the client requests the use of SSL. It then becomes easier for Mallory to forge the signature of a certificate authority that Alice trusts and have Alice trust his public key.
