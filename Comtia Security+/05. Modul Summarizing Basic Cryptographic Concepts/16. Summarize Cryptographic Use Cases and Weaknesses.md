There are many individual symmetric and asymmetric cipher algorithms and hash functions. Characteristics of these ciphers make them better suited to meeting constraints, such as use on battery-powered devices. Some of the ciphers and implementations of ciphers within products can exhibit weaknesses that make them unsuitable for use. It is important that you be able to summarize these use cases and weaknesses so that you can deploy controls that are fit for purpose.
