# SECURE SHELL

#### SECURE SHELL

**Secure Shell (SSH)** is the principal means of obtaining secure remote access to a command line terminal. The main uses of SSH are for remote administration and secure file transfer (SFTP). There are numerous commercial and open source SSH products available for all the major network operating system (NOS) platforms. The most widely used is OpenSSH (openssh.com).

SSH servers are identified by a public/private key pair (the host key). A mapping of host names to public keys can be kept manually by each SSH client or there are various enterprise software products designed for SSH host key management.

> _The host key must be changed if any compromise of the host is suspected. If an attacker has obtained the private key of a server or appliance, they can masquerade as that server or appliance and perform a man-in-the-middle attack, usually with a view to obtaining other network credentials._

The server's host key is used to set up a secure channel to use for the client to submit authentication credentials.

**SSH Client Authentication**  
SSH allows various methods for the client to authenticate to the SSH server. Each of these methods can be enabled or disabled as required on the server, using the /etc/ssh/sshd\_config file:

-   Username/password—the client submits credentials that are verified by the SSH server either against a local user database or using a RADIUS/TACACS+ server.
  
-   Public key authentication—each remote user's public key is added to a list of keys authorized for each local account on the SSH server.
  
-   Kerberos—the client submits the Kerberos credentials (a Ticket Granting Ticket) obtained when the user logged onto the workstation to the server using GSSAPI (Generic Security Services Application Program Interface). The SSH server contacts the Ticket Granting Service (in a Windows environment, this will be a domain controller) to validate the credential.
  

> _Managing valid client public keys is a critical security task. Many recent attacks on web servers have exploited poor key management. If a user's private key is compromised, delete the public key from the appliance then regenerate the key pair on the user's (remediated) client device and copy the public key to the SSH server. Always delete public keys if the user's access permissions have been revoked._

**SSH Commands**  
SSH commands are used to connect to hosts and set up authentication methods. To connect to an SSH server at 10.1.0.10 using an account named "bobby" and password authentication, run:

```Shell
ssh bobby@10.1.0.10
``` 

The following commands create a new key pair and copy it to an account on the remote server:

```Shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id bobby@10.1.0.10
``` 

At an SSH prompt, you can now use the standard Linux shell commands. Use `exit` to close the connection.

You can also use the scp command to copy a file from the remote server to the local host:

```Shell
scp bobby@10.1.0.10:/logs/audit.log audit.log
``` 

Reverse the arguments to copy a file from the local host to the remote server. To copy the contents of a directory and any subdirectories (recursively), use the `-r` option.
