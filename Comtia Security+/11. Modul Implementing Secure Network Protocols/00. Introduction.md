# Modul Implementing Secure Network Protocols

#### LESSON INTRODUCTION

When hosts join a network, they need to be configured with the appropriate settings for that network. The services that provide these settings, such as DHCP and DNS, must be deployed securely. When hosts access data using server applications, such as web/HTTP, email, and VoIP, the communications between clients and servers must be managed using secure versions of the application protocols. You will also need to configure secure protocols that allow users to access networks, host desktops, and appliance configuration interfaces remotely.

#### LESSON OBJECTIVES

In this lesson, you will:

-   Implement secure network operations protocols.
  
-   Implement secure application protocols.

Implement secure remote access protocols.
