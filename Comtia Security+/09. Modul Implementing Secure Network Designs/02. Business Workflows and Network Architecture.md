# Business Workflows and Network Architecture

#### BUSINESS WORKFLOWS AND NETWORK ARCHITECTURE

Network architecture is designed to support business workflows. You can illustrate the sorts of decisions that need to be made by analyzing a simple workflow, such as email:

-   Access—the client device must access the network, obtaining a physical channel and logical address. The user must be authenticated and authorized to use the email application. The corollary is that unauthorized users and devices must be denied access.
    
-   Email mailbox server—ensure that the mailbox is only accessed by authorized clients and that it is fully available and fault tolerant. Ensure that the email service runs with a minimum number of dependencies and that the service is designed to be resilient to faults.
    
-   Mail transfer server—this must connect with untrusted Internet hosts, so communications between the untrusted network and trusted LAN must be carefully controlled. Any data or software leaving or entering the network must be subject to policy-based controls.
    

You can see that this type of business flow will involve systems in different places in the network. Placing the client, the mailbox, and the mail transfer server all within the same logical network "segment" will introduce many vulnerabilities. Understanding and controlling how data flows between these locations is a key part of secure and effective network design.
