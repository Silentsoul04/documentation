# Modul Implementing Secure Network Designs

#### LESSON INTRODUCTION

Managing user authentication and authorization is only one part of building secure information technology services. The network infrastructure must also be designed to run services with the properties of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. While design might not be a direct responsibility for you at this stage in your career, you should understand the factors that underpin design decisions, and be able to implement a design by deploying routers, switches, access points, and load balancers in secure configurations.

#### LESSON OBJECTIVES

  
In this lesson, you will:

-   Implement secure network designs.
    
-   Implement secure routing and switching.
    
-   Implement secure wireless infrastructure.
    
-   Implement load balancers.
