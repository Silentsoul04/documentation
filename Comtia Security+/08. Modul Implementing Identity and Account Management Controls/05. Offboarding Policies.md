# Offboarding Policies

#### OFFBOARDING POLICIES

An exit interview (or **offboarding**) is the process of ensuring that an employee leaves a company gracefully. Offboarding is also used when a project using contractors or third parties ends. In terms of security, there are several processes that must be completed:

-   Account management—disable the user account and privileges. Ensure that any information assets created or managed by the employee but owned by the company are accessible (in terms of encryption keys or password-protected files).
    
-   Company assets—retrieve mobile devices, keys, smart cards, USB media, and so on. The employee will need to confirm (and in some cases prove) that they have not retained copies of any information assets.
    
-   Personal assets—wipe employee-owned devices of corporate data and applications. The employee may also be allowed to retain some information assets (such as personal emails or contact information), depending on the policies in force.
    

The departure of some types of employees should trigger additional processes to re-secure network systems. Examples include employees with detailed knowledge of security systems and procedures, and access to shared or generic account credentials. These credentials must be changed immediately.
