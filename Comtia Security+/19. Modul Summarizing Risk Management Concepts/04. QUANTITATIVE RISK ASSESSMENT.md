# QUANTITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENT

#### QUANTITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENT

There are quantitative and qualitative methods of performing risk analysis to evaluate likelihood and impact.

Quantitative risk assessment aims to assign concrete values to each risk factor.

-   **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**—the amount that would be lost in a single occurrence of the risk factor. This is determined by multiplying the value of the asset by an **Exposure Factor (EF)**. EF is the percentage of the asset value that would be lost.

-   **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**—the amount that would be lost over the course of a year. This is determined by multiplying the SLE by the **Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**.

It is important to realize that the value of an asset does not refer solely to its material value. The two principal additional considerations are direct costs associated with the asset being compromised (downtime) and consequent costs to intangible assets, such as the company's reputation. For example, a server may have a material cost of a few hundred dollars. If the server were stolen, the costs incurred from not being able to do business until it can be recovered or replaced could run to thousands of dollars. In addition, that period of interruption where orders cannot be taken or go unfulfilled leads customers to look at alternative suppliers, resulting in perhaps more thousands of lost sales and goodwill.

The problem with quantitative risk assessment is that the process of determining and assigning these values is complex and time consuming. The accuracy of the values assigned is also difficult to determine without historical data (often, it has to be based on subjective guesswork). However, over time and with experience, this approach can yield a detailed and sophisticated description of assets and risks and provide a sound basis for justifying and prioritizing security expenditure.
