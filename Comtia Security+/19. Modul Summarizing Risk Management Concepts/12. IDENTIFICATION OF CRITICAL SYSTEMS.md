# IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL SYSTEMS

#### IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL SYSTEMS

To support the resiliency of mission essential and primary business functions, it is crucial to perform an identification of critical systems. This means compiling an inventory of business processes and the assets that support them. Asset types include:

-   People (employees, visitors, and suppliers).

-   Tangible assets (buildings, furniture, equipment and machinery (plant), ICT equipment, electronic data files, and paper documents).
-   Intangible assets (ideas, commercial reputation, brand, and so on).
-   Procedures (supply chains, critical procedures, standard operating procedures).

For mission essential functions, it is important to reduce the number of dependencies between components. Dependencies are identified by performing a business process analysis (BPA) for each function. The BPA should identify the following factors:

-   Inputs—the sources of information for performing the function (including the impact if these are delayed or out of sequence).

-   Hardware—the particular server or data center that performs the processing.
-   Staff and other resources supporting the function.
-   Outputs—the data or resources produced by the function.
-   Process flow—a step-by-step description of how the function is performed.
