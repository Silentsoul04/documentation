Business impact analysis informs risk assessment by documenting the workflows that run the organization and the critical assets and systems that support them. Key metrics quantify how much downtime those systems can withstand. As a security professional, you will often be asked to produce this type of analysis.

#### BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS

**Business impact analysis (BIA**) is the process of assessing what losses might occur for a range of threat scenarios. For instance, if a DDoS attack suspends an e-commerce portal for five hours, the business impact analysis will be able to quantify the losses from orders not made and customers moving permanently to other suppliers based on historic data. The likelihood of a DoS attack can be assessed on an annualized basis to determine annualized impact, in terms of costs. You then have the information required to assess whether a security control, such as load balancing or managed DDoS mitigation, is worth the investment.

Where BIA identifies risks, business continuity planning (BCP) identifies controls and processes that enable an organization to maintain critical workflows in the face of some adverse event.

> _The term continuity of operations planning (COOP) refers to the same sorts of activities when undertaken by a government agency, rather than a business._
