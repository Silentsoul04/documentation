# NETWORK REDUNDANCY

#### NETWORK REDUNDANCY

Networking is another critical resource where a single point of failure could cause significant service disruption.

**Network Interface Card (NIC) Teaming**  
Network interface card (NIC) teaming, or adapter teaming, means that the server is installed with multiple NICs, or NICs with multiple ports, or both. Each port is connected to separate network cabling. During normal operation, this can provide a high-bandwidth link. For example, four 1 GB ports gives an overall bandwidth of 4 GB. If there is a problem with one cable, or one NIC, the network connection will continue to work, though at just 3 GB.

> _For the system to be fault tolerant, the higher bandwidth must not be critical to the function._

**Switching and Routing**  
Network cabling should be designed to allow for multiple paths between the various switches and routers, so that during a failure of one part of the network, the rest remains operational.

> _Multiple switching paths require use of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent loops._

**Load Balancers**  
NIC teaming provides load balancing at the adapter level. Load balancing and clustering can also be provisioned at a service level:

-   A load balancing switch distributes workloads between available servers.

-   A load balancing cluster enables multiple redundant servers to share data and session information to maintain a consistent service if there is failover from one server to another.
