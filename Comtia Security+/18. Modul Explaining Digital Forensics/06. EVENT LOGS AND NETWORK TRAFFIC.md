# EVENT LOGS AND NETWORK TRAFFIC

#### EVENT LOGS AND NETWORK TRAFFIC

Digital evidence is not just drawn from analysis of host system memory and data drives. An investigation may also obtain the event logs for one or more network appliances and/or server hosts. Similarly, network packet captures and traces/flows might provide valuable evidence. On a typical network, sensor and logging systems are not configured to record all network traffic, as this would generate a very considerable amount of data. On the other hand, an organization with sufficient IT resources could choose to preserve a huge amount of data. A Retrospective Network Analysis (RNA) solution provides the means to record network events at either a packet header or payload level.

For forensics, data records that are not supported by physical evidence (a data drive) must meet many tests to be admissible in court. For event logs, the drives might not be accessible or might no longer hold the original logs; for network traffic, there is no physical evidence. Where logs and network traffic are captured in a SIEM, the SIEM should demonstrate accuracy (that all relevant data was captured) and integrity (that neither party could have tampered with the data).
