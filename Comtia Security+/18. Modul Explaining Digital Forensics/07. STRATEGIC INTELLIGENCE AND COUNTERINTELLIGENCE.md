# STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

#### STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

In some cases, an organization may conduct a forensics investigation without the expectation of legal action. As well as being used in a legal process, forensics has a role to play in cybersecurity. It enables the detection of past intrusions or ongoing but unknown intrusions by close examination of available digital evidence. A famous quote attributed to former Cisco CEO John Chambers illustrates the point: "There are two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those who don't know they have been hacked."

Digital forensics can be used for information gathering to protect against espionage and hacking. This intelligence is deployed in two different ways:

-   Counterintelligence—identification and analysis of specific adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) provides information about how to configure and audit active logging systems so that they are most likely to capture evidence of attempted and successful intrusions.

-   Strategic intelligence—data and research that has been analyzed to produce actionable insights. These insights are used to inform risk management and security control provisioning to build mature cybersecurity capabilities.
