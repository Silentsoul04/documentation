The security of the hardware underpinning our network and computing devices is often overlooked. In part, this is because it is difficult for most companies to make their own investigations in this area. They have to rely on the market and security agencies to identify bad actors in supply chains. Nevertheless, it is important that you understand the issues involved in secure systems design so that you can evaluate product offerings and make recommendations for purchasing and device configuration.
