Configuring cloud security solutions shares many principles and processes with on-premises security, but plenty of unfamiliar technologies and challenges too. Weak configuration of cloud services can make many attack vectors available, and the public nature of clouds means that they will quickly be discovered and exploited. You must be able to apply policies and technical controls to provision, compute, network, and storage cloud resources with the attributes of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
