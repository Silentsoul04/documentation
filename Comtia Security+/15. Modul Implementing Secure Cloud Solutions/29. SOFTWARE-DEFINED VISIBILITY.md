# SOFTWARE-DEFINED VISIBILITY

#### SOFTWARE-DEFINED VISIBILITY

Where SDN addresses secure network "build" solutions, **software-defined visibility (SDV)** supports assessment and incident response functions. Visibility is the near real-time collection, aggregation, and reporting of data about network traffic flows and the configuration and status of all the hosts, applications, and user accounts participating in it.

SDV can help the security data collection process by gathering statistics from the forwarding systems and then applying a classification scheme to those systems to detect network traffic that deviates from baseline levels (gigamon.com/content/dam/resource-library/english/white-paper/wp-software-defined-visibility-new-paradigm-for-it.pdf). This can provide you with a more robust ability to detect anomaliesâ€”anomalies that may suggest an incident. SDV therefore gives you a high-level perspective of network flow and endpoint/user account behavior that may not be possible with traditional appliances. SDV supports designs such as zero trust and east/west (paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-zero-trust-architecture), plus implementation of security orchestration and automated response (SOAR).
