In a traditional infrastructure, an attacker may find intrusions to be difficult as the network can be isolated from the outside world. In a cloud environment, the attacker may simply need to have an Internet connection and a dictionary of stolen password hashes or SSH keys to cause a breach. A lack of oversight in the security procedures of cloud providers can dramatically increase the risk an organization takes. As a security professional, you must be able to assess the threats and vulnerabilities associated with cloud service and delivery models, plus the virtualization technologies that underpin them.
