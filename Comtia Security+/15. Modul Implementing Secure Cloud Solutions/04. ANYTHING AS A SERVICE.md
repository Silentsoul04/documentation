# ANYTHING AS A SERVICE

#### ANYTHING AS A SERVICE

There are many other examples of XaaS, reflecting the idea that anything can be provisioned as a cloud service. For example, database as a service and network as a service can be distinguished as more specific types of platform as a service. The key security consideration with all these models is identifying where responsibilities lie. This is often referred to as security in the cloud versus security of the cloud. Security in the cloud is the things you must take responsibility for; security of the cloud is the things the CSP manages. These responsibilities vary according to the service type:

Responsibility | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS
---- | ---- | ---- | ----
IAM | You | You | You (using CSP toolset)
Data security (CIA attributes/backup) | You | You | You/CSP/Both
Data privacy | You/CSP/Both | You/CSP/Both | You/CSP/Both
Application code/configuration | You | You | CSP
Virtual network/firewall | You | You/CSP | CSP
Middleware (database) code/configuration | You | CSP | CSP
Virtual Guest OS | You | CSP | CSP
Virtualization layer | CSP | CSP | CSP
Hardware layer (compute, storage, networking) | CSP | CSP | CSP
