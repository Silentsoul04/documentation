# Certificate Pinning

#### CERTIFICATE PINNING

When certificates are used by a transport protocol, such as SSL/TLS, there is a possibility that the chain of trust among the client, the server, and whatever intermediate and root CAs have provided certificates can be compromised. If an adversary can substitute a malicious but trusted certificate into the chain (using some sort of proxy or Man-in-the-Middle attack), they could be able to snoop on the supposedly secure connection.

**Pinning** refers to several techniques to ensure that when a client inspects the certificate presented by a server or a code-signed application, it is inspecting the proper certificate. This might be achieved by embedding the certificate data in the application code, or by submitting one or more public keys to an HTTP browser via an HTTP header, which is referred to as _HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP)_.

> _HPKP has serious vulnerabilities and has been deprecated ([developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public\_Key\_Pinning](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/certificate-pinning)_[). The replacement mechanism is the Certificate Transparency Framework.](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/certificate-pinning)
