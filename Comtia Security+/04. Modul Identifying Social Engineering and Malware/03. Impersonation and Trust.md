# Impersonation and Trust

#### IMPERSONATION AND TRUST

**Impersonation** simply means pretending to be someone else. It is one of the basic social engineering techniques. Impersonation can use either a consensus/liking or intimidating approach. Impersonation is possible where the target cannot verify the attacker's identity easily, such as over the phone or via an email message.

The classic impersonation attack is for the social engineer to phone into a department, claim they have to adjust something on the user's system remotely, and get the user to reveal their password. This specific attack is also referred to as _pretexting._

_Do you really know who's on the other end of the line?_

Making a convincing impersonation and establishing a trust with the target usually depends on the attacker obtaining privileged information about the organization. For example, where the attacker impersonates a member of the organization's IT support team, the attack will be more effective with identity details of the person being impersonated and the target.

Some social engineering techniques are dedicated to obtaining this type of intelligence as a reconnaissance activity. As most companies are set up toward customer service rather than security, this information is typically quite easy to come by. Information that might seem innocuous—such as department employee lists, job titles, phone numbers, diaries, invoices, or purchase orders—can help an attacker penetrate an organization through impersonation.
