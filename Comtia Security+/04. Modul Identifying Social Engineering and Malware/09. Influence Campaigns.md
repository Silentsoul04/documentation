# Influence Campaigns

#### INFLUENCE CAMPAIGNS

  
An _influence campaign_ is a major program launched by an adversary with a high level of capability, such as a nation-state actor, terrorist group, or hacktivist group. The goal of an influence campaign is to shift public opinion on some topic. Most high-profile influence campaigns that have been detected target election activity, but actors may use such campaigns to pursue a number of goals. With state actors, the concept of _soft power_ refers to using diplomatic and cultural assets to achieve an objective. When deployed along with espionage, disinformation/fake news, and hacking, a hostile campaign can be characterized as hybrid warfare ([assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/840513/20190401-MCDC\_CHW\_Information\_note\_-\_Conceptual\_Foundations.pdf](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/influence-campaigns)).

Diplomatic activity and election meddling by foreign security services has a very long history and well-established tactics. Modern campaigns can use social media to ensure wide distribution of hoaxes and invented stories. Actors can use AI-assisted bots and armies of people to open or hack accounts and repeat or reinforce messages that support the campaign's aims.

Apart from destabilizing the host country generally, influence campaigns might affect private companies because they become caught up within a fake story. It is important for companies to closely monitor references to them on social media and take steps to correct or remove false or misleading posts. When an influence campaign is detected, companies operating in critical industries—utilities, election management, transportation—should enter a heightened state of alert.
