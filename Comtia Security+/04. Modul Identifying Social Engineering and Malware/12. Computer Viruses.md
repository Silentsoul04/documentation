# Computer Viruses

#### COMPUTER VIRUSES

A computer **virus** is a type of malware designed to replicate and spread from computer to computer, usually by "infecting" executable applications or program code. There are several different types of viruses and they are generally classified by the different types of file or media that they infect:

-   Non-resident/file infector—the virus is contained within a host executable file and runs with the host process. The virus will try to infect other process images on persistent storage and perform other payload actions. It then passes control back to the host program.
-   Memory resident—when the host file is executed, the virus creates a new process for itself in memory. The **malicious process** remains in memory, even if the host process is terminated.
    
-   Boot—the virus code is written to the disk boot sector or the partition table of a fixed disk or USB media, and executes as a memory resident process when the OS starts or the media is attached to the computer.
    
-   Script and macro viruses—the malware uses the programming features available in local scripting engines for the OS and/or browser, such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), JavaScript, Microsoft Office documents with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code enabled, or PDF documents with JavaScript enabled.
    

In addition, the term _multipartite_ is used for viruses that use multiple vectors and polymorphic for viruses that can dynamically change or obfuscate their code to evade detection.

What these types of viruses have in common is that they must infect a host file or media. An infected file can be distributed through any normal means—on a disk, on a network, as an attachment to an email or social media post, or as a download from a website.
