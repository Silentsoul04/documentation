# Dumpster Diving and Tailgating

#### DUMPSTER DIVING AND TAILGATING

Social engineering includes physical attacks to steal information or gain access.

**Dumpster Diving**  
**Dumpster diving** refers to combing through an organization's (or individual's) garbage to try to find useful documents (or even files stored on discarded removable media).

> _Remember that attacks may be staged over a long period. Initial attacks may only aim at compromising low-level information and user accounts, but this low-level information can be used to attack more sensitive and confidential data and better protected management and administrative accounts._

**Tailgating and Piggy Backing**  
**Tailgating** is a means of entering a secure area without authorization by following close behind the person that has been allowed to open the door or checkpoint. _Piggy backing_ is a similar situation, but means that the attacker enters a secure area with an employee's permission. For instance, an attacker might impersonate a member of the cleaning crew and request that an employee hold the door open while they bring in a cleaning cart or mop bucket. Alternatively, piggy backing may be a means of an insider threat actor to allow access to someone without recording it in the building's entry log. Another technique is to persuade someone to hold a door open, using an excuse, such as "I've forgotten my badge/key."
