# Authentication Factors

#### AUTHENTICATION FACTORS

Assuming that an account has been created securely (the identity of the account holder has been verified), authentication verifies that only the account holder is able to use the account, and that the system may only be used by account holders. Authentication is performed when the account holder supplies the appropriate credentials (or authenticators) to the system. These are compared to the credentials stored on the system. If they match, the account is authenticated.

There are many different technologies for defining credentials and can be categorized as _factors_.

**Something You Know Authentication**  
The typical knowledge factor is the _logon_, composed of a username and a password. The username is typically not a secret (although it should not be published openly), but the password must be known only to the account holder. A passphrase is a longer password composed of several words. This has the advantages of being more secure and easier to remember. A **personal identification number (PIN)** is also something you know, although long PIN codes are hard to remember, and short codes are too vulnerable for most authentication systems. Swipe patterns are often used for authentication to touch-based devices.

A knowledge factor is also used for account reset mechanisms. For example, to reset the password on an account, the user might have to respond to a challenge question, such as, "What is your favorite movie?"

**Something You Have Authentication**  
An _ownership factor_ means that the account holder possesses something that no one else does, such as a smart card, fob, or wristband programmed with a unique identity certificate or account number. Alternatively, they might have a USB fob that generates a unique code. These ownership factors can be described as hard tokens.

A device such as a smartphone can also be used to receive a uniquely generated access code as a soft token. Unlike a password, these tokens are valid for only one use, typically within a brief time window.

**Something You Are/Do Authentication**  
A _biometric factor_ uses either physiological identifiers, such as a fingerprint, or behavioral identifiers, such as the way someone moves (gait). The identifiers are scanned and recorded as a template. When the user authenticates, another scan is taken and compared to the template.
