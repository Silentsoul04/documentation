# Multifactor Authentication

#### MULTIFACTOR AUTHENTICATION

An authentication technology is considered strong if it combines the use of more than one type of knowledge, ownership, and biometric factor, and is called **multifactor authentication (MFA)**. Single-factor authentication can quite easily be compromised: a password could be written down or shared, a smart card could be lost or stolen, and a biometric system could be subject to high error rates or spoofing.

_Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)_ combines either an ownership-based smart card or biometric identifier with something you know, such as a password or PIN. Three-factor authentication combines all three technologies, or incorporates an additional attribute, such as location; for example, a smart card with integrated fingerprint reader. This means that to authenticate, the user must possess the card, the user's fingerprint must match the template stored on the card, and the user must input a PIN or password.

> _Multifactor authentication requires a combination of different technologies. For example, requiring a PIN along with date of birth may be stronger than entering a PIN alone, but it is not multifactor._
