# Authentication Design

#### AUTHENTICATION DESIGN

_Authentication design_ refers to selecting a technology that meets requirements for confidentiality, integrity, and availability:

-   _Confidentiality_, in terms of authentication, is critical, because if account credentials are leaked, threat actors can impersonate the account holder and act on the system with whatever rights they have.
    
-   _Integrity_ means that the authentication mechanism is reliable and not easy for threat actors to bypass or trick with counterfeit credentials.
    
-   _Availability_ means that the time taken to authenticate does not impede workflows and is easy enough for users to operate.
    

Authentication is used in different contexts and factors are not always well-suited to a context. For example, you might authenticate to a PC by inputting a password to get access to the device. This might also authenticate you to a network. But authentication is also used for physical security. If you consider numerous employees arriving for work, asking them to type a password to gain access to the building would take too long and cause huge disruption (lack of availability). It is also highly likely that passwords would be observed (lack of confidentiality). Finally, it is likely that users would simply start holding the door open for each other (lack of integrity). Authentication design tries to anticipate these issues and implements a technology that fits the use case.
