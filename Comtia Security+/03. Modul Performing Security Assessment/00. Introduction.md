# Modul Performing Security Assessment

#### LESSON INTRODUCTION

Security assessment refers to processes and tools that evaluate the attack surface. With knowledge of adversary tactics and capabilities, you can assess whether points on the attack surface are potentially vulnerable attack vectors. The output of assessment is recommendations for deploying, enhancing, or reconfiguring security controls to mitigate the risk that vulnerabilities are exploitable by threat actors.

#### LESSON OBJECTIVES

In this lesson, you will:

-   Assess organizational security with network reconnaissance tools.
-   Explain security concerns with general vulnerability types.
-   Summarize vulnerability scanning techniques.
-   Explain penetration testing concepts.
