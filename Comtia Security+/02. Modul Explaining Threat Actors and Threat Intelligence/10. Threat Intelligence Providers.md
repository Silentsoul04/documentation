# Threat Intelligence Providers

#### THREAT INTELLIGENCE PROVIDERS

The outputs from the primary research undertaken by security solutions providers and academics can take three main forms:

-   Behavioral threat research—narrative commentary describing examples of attacks and TTPs gathered through primary research sources.
-   **Reputational threat intelligence**—lists of IP addresses and domains associated with malicious behavior, plus signatures of known file-based malware.
-   Threat data—computer data that can correlate events observed on a customer's own networks and logs with known TTP and threat actor indicators.

Threat data can be packaged as feeds that integrate with a security information and event management (SIEM) platform. These feeds are usually described as **cyber threat intelligence (CTI)** data. The data on its own is not a complete security solution however. To produce actionable intelligence, the threat data must be correlated with observed data from customer networks. This type of analysis is often powered by **artificial intelligence (AI)** features of the SIEM.

Threat intelligence platforms and feeds are supplied as one of three different commercial models:

-   **Closed/proprietary**—the threat research and CTI data is made available as a paid subscription to a commercial threat intelligence platform. The security solution provider will also make the most valuable research available early to platform subscribers in the form of blogs, white papers, and webinars. Some examples of such platforms include:
    
    -   IBM X-Force Exchange ([exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-intelligence-providers))
    -   FireEye ([fireeye.com/solutions/cyber-threat-intelligence/threat-intelligence-subscriptions.html](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-intelligence-providers))
    -   Recorded Future ([recordedfuture.com/solutions/threat-intelligence-feeds](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-intelligence-providers))

-   Vendor websites—proprietary threat intelligence is not always provided at cost. All types of security, hardware, and software vendors make huge amounts of threat research available via their websites as a general benefit to their customers. One example is Microsoft's Security Intelligence blog ([microsoft.com/security/blog/microsoft-security-intelligence](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-intelligence-providers)).
    
-   Public/private information sharing centers—in many critical industries, **Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)** have been set up to share threat intelligence and promote best practice ([nationalisacs.org/member-isacs](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-intelligence-providers)). These are sector-specific resources for companies and agencies working in critical industries, such as power supply, financial markets, or aviation. Where there is no coverage by an ISAC, local industry groups and associations may come together to provide mutual support.
-   **Open source intelligence (OSINT)**—some companies operate threat intelligence services on an open-source basis, earning income from consultancy rather than directly from the platform or research effort. Some examples include:
    
    -   AT&T Security, previously Alien Vault Open Threat Exchange (OTX) ([otx.alienvault.com](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-intelligence-providers))
    -   Malware Information Sharing Project (MISP) ([misp-project.org/feeds](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-intelligence-providers))
    -   Spamhaus ([spamhaus.org/organization](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-intelligence-providers))
    -   VirusTotal ([virustotal.com](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-intelligence-providers))
    
    > _As well as referring to open-source threat research providers, OSINT can mean any intelligence derived from publicly available information. OSINT is a common reconnaissance technique where the attacker harvests domains, IP address ranges, employees, and other data that will assist in identifying attack vectors. Companies should also monitor public networks for signs of attack planning (chatter on forums) and breaches (confidential information or account credentials posted to online forums). Most commercial providers offer monitoring services, which can include dark web sources (fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/products/pdfs/pf/intel/ds-digital-threat-monitoring.pdf)._
