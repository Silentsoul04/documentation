# Threat Research Sources

#### THREAT RESEARCH SOURCES

Threat research is a counterintelligence gathering effort in which security companies and researchers attempt to discover the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of modern cyber adversaries. There are many companies and academic institutions engaged in primary cybersecurity research. Security solution providers with firewall and anti-malware platforms derive a lot of data from their own customers' networks. As they assist customers with cybersecurity operations, they are able to analyze and publicize TTPs and their indicators. These organizations also operate honeynets to try to observe how hackers interact with vulnerable systems.

Another primary source of threat intelligence is the **dark web**. The deep web is any part of the World Wide Web that is not indexed by a search engine. This includes pages that require registration, pages that block search indexing, unlinked pages, pages using nonstandard DNS, and content encoded in a nonstandard manner. Within the deep web, are areas that are deliberately concealed from "regular" browser access.

-   Dark net—a network established as an overlay to Internet infrastructure by software, such as The Onion Router (TOR), Freenet, or I2P, that acts to anonymize usage and prevent a third party from knowing about the existence of the network or analyzing any activity taking place over the network. Onion routing, for instance, uses multiple layers of encryption and relays between nodes to achieve this anonymity.
    
-   Dark web—sites, content, and services accessible only over a dark net. While there are dark web search engines, many sites are hidden from them. Access to a dark web site via its URL is often only available via "word of mouth" bulletin boards.

Investigating these dark web sites and message boards is a valuable source of counterintelligence. The anonymity of dark web services has made it easy for investigators to infiltrate the forums and webstores that have been set up to exchange stolen data and hacking tools. As adversaries react to this, they are setting up new networks and ways of identifying law enforcement infiltration. Consequently, dark nets and the dark web represent a continually shifting landscape.
