# Modul Explaining Threat Actors and Threat Intelligence

#### LESSON INTRODUCTION

To make an effective security assessment, you must be able to explain strategies for both defense and attack. Your responsibilities are likely to lie principally in defending assets, but to do this you must be able to explain the tactics, techniques, and procedures of threat actors. You must also be able to differentiate the types and capabilities of threat actors. As the threat landscape is continually evolving, you must also be able to identify reliable sources of threat intelligence and research.

#### Lesson Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

-   Explain threat actor types and attack vectors.
-   Explain threat intelligence sources.
