> _1.3 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with application attacks_

Attacks against desktop and server applications allow threat actors to run arbitrary code on trusted hosts, allowing them to gain a foothold on the network or move laterally within it. With sufficient privileges and access, an attacker can quickly move to compromising data assets or causing denial of service against critical servers. Not all of these attacks will be detected automatically, so as a security professional, you must be able to identify indicators of arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation from your host monitoring and logging systems.
