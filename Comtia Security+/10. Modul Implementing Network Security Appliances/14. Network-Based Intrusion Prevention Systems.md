# Network-Based Intrusion Prevention Systems

#### NETWORK-BASED INTRUSION PREVENTION SYSTEMS

Compared to the passive function of an IDS, an **intrusion prevention system (IPS)** can provide an active response to any network threats that it matches. One typical preventive measure is to end the TCP session, sending a TCP reset packet to the attacking host. Another option is for the IPS to apply a temporary filter on the firewall to block the attacker's IP address (shunning). Other advanced measures include throttling bandwidth to attacking hosts, applying complex firewall filters, and even modifying suspect packets to render them harmless. Finally, the appliance may be able to run a script or third-party program to perform some other action not supported by the IPS software itself.

Some IPS provide inline, wire-speed antivirus scanning. Their rulesets can be configured to provide user content filtering, such as blocking URLs, applying keyword-sensitive block lists or allow lists, or applying time-based access restrictions.

IPS appliances are positioned like firewalls at the border between two network zones. As with proxy servers, the appliances are "inline" with the network, meaning that all traffic passes through them (also making them a single point-of-failure if there is no fault tolerance mechanism). This means that they need to be able to cope with high bandwidths and process each packet very quickly to avoid slowing down the network.
