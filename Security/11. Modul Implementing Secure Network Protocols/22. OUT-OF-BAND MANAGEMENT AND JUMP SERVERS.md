# OUT-OF-BAND MANAGEMENT AND JUMP SERVERS

#### OUT-OF-BAND MANAGEMENT AND JUMP SERVERS

Remote access management refers to the specific use case of using a secure channel to administer a network appliance or server. The secure admin workstations (SAWs) used to perform management functions must be tightly locked down, ideally installed with no software other than that required to access the administrative channelâ€”minimal web browser, remote desktop client, or SSH virtual terminal, for instance. SAWs should be denied Internet access or be restricted to a handful of approved vendor sites (for patches, drivers, and support). The devices must also be subject to stringent access control and auditing so that any misuse is detected at the earliest opportunity.

**Out-of-Band Management**  
Remote management methods can be described as either in-band or **out-of-band (OOB)**. An in-band management link is one that shares traffic with other communications on the "production" network. A serial console or modem port on a router is a physically out-of-band management method. When using a browser-based management interface or a virtual terminal over Ethernet and IP, the link can be made out-of-band by connecting the port used for management access to physically separate network infrastructure. This can be costly to implement, but out-of-band management is more secure and means that access to the device is preserved when there are problems affecting the production network. With an in-band connection, better security can be implemented by using a VLAN to isolate management traffic. This makes it harder for potential eavesdroppers to view or modify traffic passing over the management interface. This sort of virtual OOB does still mean that access could be compromised by a system-wide network failure, however.

**Jump Servers**  
One of the challenges of managing hosts that are exposed to the Internet, such as in a DMZ or cloud virtual network, is to provide administrative access to the servers and appliances located within it. On the one hand, a link is necessary; on the other, the administrative interface could be compromised and exploited as a pivot point into the rest of the network. Consequently, the management hosts permitted to access administrative interfaces on hosts in the secure zone must be tightly controlled. Configuring and auditing this type of control when there are many different servers operating in the zone is complex.

One solution to this complexity is to add a single administration server, or **jump server**, to the secure zone. The jump server only runs the necessary administrative port and protocol (typically SSH or RDP). Administrators connect to the jump server then use the jump server to connect to the admin interface on the application server. The application server's admin interface has a single entry in its ACL (the jump server) and denies connection attempts from any other hosts.
