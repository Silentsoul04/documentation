# DNS SECURITY

#### DNS SECURITY

DNS is a critical service that should be configured to be fault tolerant. DoS attacks are hard to perform against the servers that perform Internet name resolution, but if an attacker can target the DNS server on a private network, it is possible to seriously disrupt the operation of that network.

To ensure DNS security on a private network, local DNS servers should only accept recursive queries from local hosts (preferably authenticated local hosts) and not from the Internet. You also need to implement access control measures on the server, to prevent a malicious user from altering records manually. Similarly, clients should be restricted to using authorized resolvers to perform name resolution.

Attacks on DNS may also target the server application and/or configuration. Many DNS services run on BIND (Berkley Internet Name Domain), distributed by the Internet Software Consortium (isc.org). There are known vulnerabilities in many versions of the BIND server, so it is critical to patch the server to the latest version. The same general advice applies to other DNS server software, such as Microsoft's. Obtain and check security announcements and then test and apply critical and security-related patches and upgrades.

DNS footprinting means obtaining information about a private network by using its DNS server to perform a zone transfer (all the records in a domain) to a rogue DNS or simply by querying the DNS service, using a tool such as nslookup or dig. To prevent this, you can apply an Access Control List to prevent zone transfers to unauthorized hosts or domains, to prevent an external server from obtaining information about the private network architecture.

**DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)** help to mitigate against spoofing and poisoning attacks by providing a validation process for DNS responses. With DNSSEC enabled, the authoritative server for the zone creates a "package" of resource records (called an RRset) signed with a private key (the Zone Signing Key). When another server requests a secure record exchange, the authoritative server returns the package along with its public key, which can be used to verify the signature.

The public zone signing key is itself signed with a separate Key Signing Key. Separate keys are used so that if there is some sort of compromise of the zone signing key, the domain can continue to operate securely by revoking the compromised key and issuing a new one.

The Key Signing Key for a particular domain is validated by the parent domain or host ISP. The top-level domain trusts are validated by the Regional Internet Registries and the DNS root servers are self-validated, using a type of M-of-N control group key signing. This establishes a chain of trust from the root servers down to any particular subdomain.
