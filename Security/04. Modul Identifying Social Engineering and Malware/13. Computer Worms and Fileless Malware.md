# Computer Worms and Fileless Malware

#### COMPUTER WORMS AND FILELESS MALWARE

A computer **worm** is memory-resident malware that can run without user intervention and replicate over network resources. A virus is executed only when the user performs an action such as downloading and running an infected executable process, attaching an infected USB stick, or opening an infected Word document with macros enabled. By contrast, a worm can execute by exploiting a vulnerability in a process when the user browses a website, runs a vulnerable server application, or is connected to an infected file share. For example, the Code-Red worm was able to infect early versions of Microsoft's IIS web server software via a buffer overflow vulnerability. It then scanned randomly generated IP ranges to try to infect other vulnerable IIS servers ([caida.org/research/security/code-red](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/computer-worms-and-fileless-malware)).

The primary effect of the first types of computer worm is to rapidly consume network bandwidth as the worm replicates. A worm may also be able to crash an operating system or server application (performing a Denial of Service attack). Also, like viruses, worms can carry a payload that may perform some other malicious action.

The Conficker worm illustrated the potential for remote code execution and memory-resident malware to effect highly potent attacks ([secureworks.com/research/downadup-removal). As malware has continued to be developed for criminal intent and security software became better able to detect and block static threats, malware code and techniques have become more sophisticated. The term _fileless_ has gained prominence to refer to these modern types of malware. Fileless is not a definitive classification, but it describes a collection of common behaviors and techniques:](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/computer-worms-and-fileless-malware)

-   Fileless malware does not write its code to disk. The malware uses memory resident techniques to run in its own process, within a host process or dynamic link library (DLL), or within a scripting host. This does not mean that there is no disk activity at all, however. The malware may change registry values to achieve persistence (executing if the host computer is restarted). The initial execution of the malware may also depend on the user running a downloaded script, file attachment, or Trojan software package.
    
-   Fileless malware uses lightweight **shellcode** to achieve a backdoor mechanism on the host. The shellcode is easy to recompile in an obfuscated form to evade detection by scanners. It is then able to download additional packages or payloads to achieve the actor's actions on objectives. These packages can also be obfuscated, streamed, and compiled on the fly to evade automated detection.
    
-   Fileless malware may use "live off the land" techniques rather than compiled executables to evade detection. This means that the malware code uses legitimate system scripting tools, notably PowerShell and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), to execute payload actions. If they can be executed with sufficient permissions, these environments provide all the tools the attacker needs to perform scanning, reconfigure settings, and exfiltrate data.
    

The terms advanced persistent threat (APT) and advanced volatile threat (AVT) can be used to describe this general class of modern fileless/live off the land malware. Another useful classification is low observable characteristics (LOC) attack (mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/ransomware/what-is-fileless-malware.html). The exact classification is less important than the realization that adversaries can use any variety of coding tricks to effect intrusions and that their tactics, techniques, and procedures to evade detection are continually evolving.
