# Social Engineering Principles

#### SOCIAL ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

Social engineering is one of the most common and successful malicious techniques. Because it exploits basic human trust, social engineering has proven to be a particularly effective way of manipulating people into performing actions that they might not otherwise perform. To be persuasive, social engineering attacks rely on one or more of the following principles.

**Familiarity/Liking**  
Some people have the sort of natural charisma that allows them to persuade others to do as they request. One of the basic tools of a social engineer is simply to be affable and likable, and to present the requests they make as completely reasonable and unobjectionable. This approach is relatively low-risk as even if the request is refused, it is less likely to cause suspicion and the social engineer may be able to move on to a different target without being detected.

**Consensus/Social Proof**  
The _principle of consensus_ or _social proof_ refers to the fact that without an explicit instruction to behave in a certain way, many people will act just as they think others would act. A social engineering attack can use this instinct either to persuade the target that to refuse a request would be odd ("That's not something anyone else has ever said no to") or to exploit polite behavior to slip into a building while someone holds the door for them. As another example, an attacker may be able to fool a user into believing that a malicious website is actually legitimate by posting numerous fake reviews and testimonials praising the site. The victim, believing many different people have judged the site acceptable, takes this as evidence of the site's legitimacy and places their trust in it.

**Authority and Intimidation**  
Many people find it difficult to refuse a request by someone they perceive as superior in rank or expertise. Social engineers can try to exploit this behavior to intimidate their target by pretending to be a senior executive. An attack might be launched by impersonating someone who would often be deferred to, such as a police officer, judge, or doctor. Another technique is using spurious technical arguments and jargon. Social engineering can exploit the fact that few people are willing to admit ignorance. Compared to using a familiarity/liking sort of approach, this sort of adversarial tactic might be riskier to the attacker as there is a greater chance of arousing suspicion and the target reporting the attack attempt.

**Scarcity and Urgency**  
Often also deployed by salespeople, creating a false sense of scarcity or urgency can disturb people's ordinary decision-making process. The social engineer can try to pressure his or her target by demanding a quick response. For example, the social engineer might try to get the target to sign up for a "limited time" or "invitation-only" trial and request a username and password for the service (hoping that the target will offer a password he or she has used for other accounts). Fake antivirus products generate a sense of urgency by trying to trick users into thinking that their computer is already infected with malware.
