# Spam, Hoaxes, and Prepending

#### SPAM, HOAXES, AND PREPENDING

Unsolicited email, or **spam**, is used as the vector for many attacks. Threat actors harvest email addresses from marketing lists or databases of historic privacy breaches, or might try to target every email address at a certain company. Mass mail attacks could also be perpetrated over any type of instant messaging or Internet messaging service (**SPIM**).

**Hoaxes**, such as security alerts or chain emails, are another common social engineering technique, often combined with phishing attacks. An email alert or web pop-up will claim to have identified some sort of security problem, such as virus infection, and offer a tool to fix the problem. The tool of course will be some sort of Trojan application. Malvertising exploits the use of space on legitimate websites set aside for advertising served from content delivery networks (CDNs) without much oversight ([blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/07/malvertising-deepdive.html](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/spam-hoaxes-and-prepending)). Criminals will also use sophisticated phone call scams to try to trick users into revealing login credentials or financial account details.

A phishing or hoax email can be made more convincing by prepending. In an offensive sense, _prepending_ means adding text that appears to have been generated by the mail system. For example, an attacker may add "RE:" to the subject line to make it appear as though the message is a reply or may add something like "MAILSAFE: PASSED" to make it appear as though a message has been scanned and accepted by some security software. Conversely, some mail systems may perform prepending legitimately, such as tagging external messages or messages with a warning if they have not been definitively identified as spam but that do have suspicious elements.
