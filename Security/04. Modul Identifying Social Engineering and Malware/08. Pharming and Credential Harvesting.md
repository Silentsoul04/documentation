# Pharming and Credential Harvesting

#### PHARMING AND CREDENTIAL HARVESTING

Direct messages to a single contact have quite a high chance of failure. Other social engineering techniques still use spoofed resources, such as fake sites and login pages, but rely on redirection or passive methods to entrap victims.

**Pharming**  
**Pharming** is a passive means of redirecting users from a legitimate website to a malicious one. Rather than using social engineering techniques to trick the user, pharming relies on corrupting the way the victim's computer performs Internet name resolution, so that they are redirected from the genuine site to the malicious one. For example, if mybank.foo should point to the IP address 2.2.2.2, a pharming attack would corrupt the name resolution process to make it point to IP address 6.6.6.6.

**Typosquatting**  
Rather than redirection, a threat actor might use **typosquatting**. This means that the threat actor registers a domain name that is very similar to a real one, such as `connptia.org`, hoping that users will not notice the difference. These are also referred to as _cousin_, _lookalike_, or _doppelganger_ domains. Typosquatting might be used for pharming and phishing attacks. Another technique is to register a hijacked subdomain using the primary domain of a trusted cloud provider, such as `onmicrosoft.com`. If a phishing message appears to come from `comptia.onmicrosoft.com`, many users will be inclined to trust it.

**Watering Hole Attack**  
A **watering hole attack** is another passive technique where the threat actor does not have to risk communicating directly with the target. It relies on the circumstance that a group of targets may use an unsecure third-party website. For example, staff running an international e-commerce site might use a local pizza delivery firm. If an attacker can compromise the pizza delivery firm's website or deploy a type of malvertising, they may be able infect the computers of the e-commerce company's employees and penetrate the e-commerce company systems.

**Credential Harvesting**  
Within the general realm of phishing and pharming, **credential harvesting** is a campaign specifically designed to steal account credentials. The attacker may have more interest in selling the database of captured logins than trying to exploit them directly. Such attacks will use an alarming message such as "Your account is being used to host child pornography" or "There is a problem with your account storage" and a link to a pharming site embroidered with the logos of a legitimate service provider, such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or Twitter. Attacks using malvertising or scripts injected into shopping cart code are also popular ([csoonline.com/article/3400381/what-is-magecart-how-this-hacker-group-steals-payment-card-data.html](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/pharming-and-credential-harvesting)). Targeted credential harvesting might be directed against a single company's password reset or account management portal.
