# Identity Fraud and Invoice Scams

#### IDENTITY FRAUD AND INVOICE SCAMS

**Identity fraud** is a specific type of impersonation where the attacker uses specific details of someone's identity. A typical consumer identity fraud is using someone else's name and address to make a loan application or using stolen credit card details to start a mobile phone contract. Invoice scams are another common type of identity fraud. The fraudster will usually spoof the invoice details of a genuine supplier, but change the bank account number. This might rely on the target not double-checking the account, or it might be combined with a social engineering contact call to convince the target that the account change is genuine.

> _Sometimes the terms identity fraud and identity theft are used to distinguish between making up an identity versus stealing someone else's identity._

In terms of attacks on corporate networks, identity fraud is likely to involve compromising a computer account. Various social engineering techniques can be used to obtain account credentials without having to rely on malware, Apart from eliciting credential information from a user directly, some of these techniques include:

-   Credential databases—account details from previous attacks are widely available ([haveibeenpwned.com](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/identity-fraud-and-invoice-scams)). An attacker can try to match a target in one of these databases and hope that they have reused a password. The attacker could also leverage third-party sites for impersonation. For example, rather than using a work account, they could gain control of a social media account.
    
-   **Shoulder surfing**—a threat actor can learn a password or PIN (or other secure information) by watching the user type it. Despite the name, the attacker may not have to be in close proximity to the target—they could use high-powered binoculars or CCTV to directly observe the target remotely.
    
-   Lunchtime attacks—most authentication methods are dependent on the physical security of the workstation. If a user leaves a workstation unattended while logged on, an attacker can physically gain access to the system. This is often described as a _lunchtime attack_. Most operating systems are set to activate a password-protected screen saver after a defined period of no keyboard or mouse activity. Users should also be trained to lock or log off the workstation whenever they leave it unattended.
