> _1.1 Compare and contrast different types of social engineering techniques_

People—employees, contractors, suppliers, and customers—represent part of the attack surface of any organization. A person with permissions on the system is a potential target of social engineering. Being able to compare and contrast social engineering techniques will help you to lead security awareness training and to develop policies and other security controls to mitigate these risks.

#### SOCIAL ENGINEERING

Adversaries can use a diverse range of techniques to compromise a security system. A prerequisite of many types of attacks is to obtain information about the network and security system. Social engineering refers to means of either eliciting information from someone or getting them to perform some action for the threat actor. It can also be referred to as "hacking the human." Social engineering might be used to gather intelligence as reconnaissance in preparation for an intrusion, or it might be used to effect an actual intrusion. Typical social engineering intrusion scenarios include:

-   An attacker creates an executable file that prompts a network user for their password, and then records whatever the user inputs. The attacker then emails the executable file to the user with the story that the user must double-click the file and log on to the network again to clear up some logon problems the organization has been experiencing that morning. After the user complies, the attacker now has access to their network credentials.
    
-   An attacker contacts the help desk pretending to be a remote sales representative who needs assistance setting up remote access. Through a series of phone calls, the attacker obtains the name/address of the remote access server and login credentials, in addition to phone numbers for remote access and for accessing the organization's private phone and voice-mail system.
    
-   An attacker triggers a fire alarm and then slips into the building during the confusion and attaches a monitoring device to a network port.
