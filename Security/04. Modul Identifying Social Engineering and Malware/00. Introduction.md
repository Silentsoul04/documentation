# Modul Identifying Social Engineering and Malware

#### LESSON INTRODUCTION

It is not sufficient for security assessments to focus solely on software vulnerabilities and configuration errors. As well as these hardware and software systems, the attack surface contains a company's employees and the degree to which they can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or privileges. Threat actors use social engineering techniques to elicit information, obtain access to premises, and to trick users into running malicious code. You must understand these attacks and train your colleagues and customers with the ability to detect and report them. As well as being able to explain these techniques, you must be able to describe the indicators associated with different types of malware and analyze your systems for possible infections.

#### LESSON OBJECTIVES

In this lesson, you will:

-   Compare and contrast social engineering techniques.
    
-   Analyze indicators of malware-based attacks.
