# Modul Implementing Cybersecurity Resilience

#### LESSON INTRODUCTION

Cybersecurity resilience means that even successful intrusions by threat actors have limited impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Provisioning redundancy in storage, power, and network systems, plus effective backup procedures, site resiliency, and effective procedures for change control and configuration management are crucial in maintaining high availability.

#### LESSON OBJECTIVES

In this lesson, you will:

-   Implement redundancy strategies.
-   Implement backup strategies.
-   Implement cybersecurity resiliency strategies.
