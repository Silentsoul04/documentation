# Summarize Vulnerability Scanning Techniques

> EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED  
> _1.7 Summarize the techniques used in security assessments_

Automated vulnerability scanning is a key part of both initial security assessment and ongoing compliance monitoring. You should be able to summarize types of scanners and explain the impact of scan configurations. You should also be able to contribute to threat hunting security assessments and explain how they can be supported by threat intelligence platforms.

#### SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

Network reconnaissance and discovery is used to identify hosts, network topology, and open services/ports, establishing an overall attack surface. Various types of security assessments can be used to test these hosts and services for vulnerabilities. There are many models and frameworks for conducting security assessments. A good starting point is NIST's Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment ([nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/summarize-vulnerability-scanning-techniques)). SP 800-115 identifies three principal activities within an assessment:

-   Testing the object under assessment to discover vulnerabilities or to prove the effectiveness of security controls.
    
-   Examining assessment objects to understand the security system and identify any logical weaknesses. This might highlight a lack of security controls or a common misconfiguration.
    
-   Interviewing personnel to gather information and probe attitudes toward and understanding of security.
    

The main types of security assessment are usually classed as **vulnerability assessment**, **threat hunting**, and penetration testing. A vulnerability assessment is an evaluation of a system's security and ability to meet compliance requirements based on the configuration state of the system. Essentially, the vulnerability assessment determines if the current configuration matches the ideal configuration (the baseline). Vulnerability assessments might involve manual inspection of security controls, but are more often accomplished through automated vulnerability scanners.
