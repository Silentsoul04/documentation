Performing a security assessment effectively is not simply a matter of choosing appropriate tools. You need to understand the types of vulnerabilities that affect information systems and networks. You must also be able to evaluate and explain the impacts that can arise from vulnerabilities, so that assessment and remediation activities can be given priority where they are most needed.

####   
SOFTWARE VULNERABILITIES AND PATCH MANAGEMENT

Software exploitation means an attack that targets a vulnerability in software code. An application vulnerability is a design flaw that can cause the security system to be circumvented or that will cause the application to crash. Typically, vulnerabilities can only be exploited in quite specific circumstances but because of the complexity of modern software and the speed with which new versions must be released to market, almost no software is free from vulnerabilities. As two contrasting examples, consider vulnerabilities affecting Adobe's PDF document reader versus a vulnerability in the server software underpinning transport security. The former could give a threat actors a foothold on a corporate network via a workstation; the latter could expose the cryptographic keys used to provide secure web services to compromise. Both are potentially high impact for different reasons.

It is also important to realize that software vulnerabilities affect all types of code, not just applications:

-   Operating system (OS)—an application exploit will run with the permissions of the logged on user, which will hopefully be limited. A vulnerability in an OS kernel file or shared library is more likely to allow privilege escalation, where the malware code runs with higher access rights (system or root). Dirty COW is one example of a Linux kernel vulnerability ([access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2757141](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/explain-security-concerns-with-general-vulnerability-types)).
    
-   Firmware—vulnerabilities can exist in the BIOS/UEFI firmware that controls the boot process for PCs. There can also be bugs in device firmware, such as network cards and disk controllers. Finally, network appliances and Internet of Things (IoT) devices run OS code as a type of firmware. Like kernel vulnerabilities, firmware exploits can be difficult to identify, because the exploit code can run with the highest level of privilege. The Intel AMT vulnerability illustrates the impacts of a firmware vulnerability ([blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Evdokimov-Intel-AMT-Stealth-Breakthrough-wp.pdf](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/explain-security-concerns-with-general-vulnerability-types)).
    

Most vulnerabilities are discovered by software and security researchers, who notify the vendor to give them time to patch the vulnerability before releasing details to the wider public. Improper or weak patch management is an additional layer of vulnerability where these security patches are not applied to systems, leaving them vulnerable to exploits. Poor configuration management may mean that the organization is simply not documenting and managing its assets rigorously. Patches may be deployed to some systems, but not others. Patches may be applied and then removed because they cause performance issues.
