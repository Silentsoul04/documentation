# Open-source versus Proprietary Firewalls

#### OPEN-SOURCE VERSUS PROPRIETARY FIREWALLS

The ability to inspect source code will be a requirement for high-security environments that cannot rely on implicit trust when selecting vendors. The code underpinning appliance-based, software, and virtual firewalls can be developed as open-source or proprietary or somewhere in between:

-   Wholly proprietary—implemented as a proprietary OS, such as Cisco ASA, Juniper JunOS, PaloAlto PAN-OS, or Barracuda's Windows-based appliance.
    
-   Mostly proprietary—developed from a Linux kernel, but with proprietary features added. Examples include Check Point IPSO, FortiGate FortiOS, and Sonicwall. Any code developed from a GPL source should be available, but in general terms these products cannot be used independently of a commercial contract with the vendor.
    
-   Wholly open-source—these can be used independently of the vendor, but the vendors typically have commercial appliances and support contracts too. Examples include pfSense and Smoothwall.
    

In determining whether to follow a self-installed versus supported deployment, as well as the core appliance code, you need to consider access to support, update availability, and access to subscription-based features, such as signatures and threat feeds.
