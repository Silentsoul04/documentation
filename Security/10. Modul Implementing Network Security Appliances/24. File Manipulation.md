# File Manipulation

#### FILE MANIPULATION

While SIEM can automate many functions of log collection and review, you may also have to manually prepare data using a Linux command line.

**The cat Command**  
The Linux **command cat** allows you to view the contents of one or more files. For example, if you want to view the whole contents of two rotated log files, you could run:

```Bash
cat -n access.log access2.log
```

The `-n` switch adds line numbers. If you wanted to output to a new file rather than the terminal, you can run:

```Bash
cat -n access.log access2.log > access_cat.log
```

**The head and tail Commands**  
The **head** and **tail commands** output the first and last 10 lines respectively of a file you provide. You can also adjust this default value to output more or fewer lines using the -n switch. For example, the following command shows the 20 most recent entries in a log file:

```Bash
tail /var/log/messages -n 20
```

**The logger Command**  
The **logger command** writes input to the local system log or to a remote syslog server ([linux.die.net/man/1/logger](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/file-manipulation)). You can use the command in a script to write any text string or use the -f option to write the contents of another file. You can also write the output of commands by enclosing the command in backticks. The following command writes the name of the local machine along with the text "up" to the syslog server at 10.1.0.242:

```Bash
logger -n 10.1.0.242 `hostname` up
```
