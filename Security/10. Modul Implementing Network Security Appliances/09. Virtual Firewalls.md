# Virtual Firewalls

#### VIRTUAL FIREWALLS

Virtual firewalls are usually deployed within data centers and cloud services. A virtual firewall can be implemented in three different ways:

-   Hypervisor-based—this means that filtering functionality is built into the hypervisor or cloud provisioning tool. You can use the cloud's web app or application programming interface (API) to write access control lists (ACLs) for traffic arriving or leaving a virtual host or virtual network.
    
-   Virtual appliance—this refers to deploying a vendor firewall appliance instance using virtualization, in the same way you might deploy a Windows or Linux guest OS.
    
-   Multiple context—this refers to multiple virtual firewall instances running on a hardware firewall appliance. Each context has a separate interface and can perform a distinct filtering role.
    

While they can be deployed like "regular" firewalls for zone-based routing and filtering, virtual firewalls most significant role is to support the east-west security and zero-trust microsegmentation design paradigms. They are able to inspect traffic as it passes from host-to-host or between virtual networks, rather than requiring that traffic be routed up to a firewall appliance and back.
