# MACROS AND VISUAL BASIC FOR APPLICATIONS (VBA)

#### MACROS AND VISUAL BASIC FOR APPLICATIONS (VBA)

A document macro is a sequence of actions performed in the context of a word processor, spreadsheet, or presentation file. While the user may be able to record macro steps using the GUI, ultimately macros are coded in a scripting language. Microsoft Office uses the **Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)** language, while PDF documents use JavaScript. Microsoft Office document macros can be inspected using ALT+F11. Other vendors and open-source software also implement macro functionality, using languages such as Basic or Python.

A malicious actor will try to use a macro-enabled document to execute arbitrary code. For example, a Word document could be the vector for executing a malicious PowerShell script. Macros are disabled by default in Office, but the attacker may be able to use a social engineering attack to get the user to change the policy.

With PDF, the JavaScript might be embedded within the document and designed to exploit a known vulnerability in the reader software to execute without authorization (sentinelone.com/blog/malicious-pdfs-revealing-techniques-behind-attacks).
