# MEMORY LEAKS AND RESOURCE EXHAUSTION

#### MEMORY LEAKS AND RESOURCE EXHAUSTION

If a process is operating correctly, when it no longer requires a block of memory, it should release it. If the program code does not do this, it could create a situation where the system continually leaks memory to the faulty process. This means less memory is available to other processes and the system could crash. Memory leaks are particularly serious in service/background applications, as they will continue to consume memory over an extended period. **Memory leaks** in the OS kernel are also extremely serious. A memory leak may itself be a sign of a malicious or corrupted process.

More generally, a malicious process might cause denial of service or set up the conditions for privilege escalation via resource exhaustion. Resources refers to CPU time, system memory allocation, fixed disk capacity, and network utilization. A malicious process could spawn multiple looping threads to use up CPU time, or write thousands of files to disk. Distributed attacks against network applications perform a type of resource exhaustion attack by starting but not completing sessions, causing the application to fill up its state table, leaving no opportunities for genuine clients to connect.
