# Fingerprint Recognition

#### FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION

Physiologic biometric features represent a something you are factor. They include fingerprint patterns, iris or retina recognition, or facial recognition.

Fingerprint recognition is the most widely implemented biometric authentication method. The technology required for scanning and recording fingerprints is relatively inexpensive and the process quite straightforward. A fingerprint sensor is usually implemented as a small capacitive cell that can detect the unique pattern of ridges making up the pattern. The technology is also non-intrusive and relatively simple to use, although moisture or dirt can prevent readings.

The main problem with **fingerprint scanners** is that it is possible to obtain a copy of a user's fingerprint and create a mold of it that will fool the scanner ([tomsguide.com/us/iphone-touch-id-hack,news-20066.html](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/fingerprint-recognition)). These concerns are addressed by vein matching scanners, or vascular biometrics. This requires a more complex scanner—an infrared light source and camera—to create a template from the unique pattern of blood vessels in a person's finger or palm.
