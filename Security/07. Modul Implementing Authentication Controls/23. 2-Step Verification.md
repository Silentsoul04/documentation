# 2-Step Verification

#### 2-STEP VERIFICATION

_2-step verification_ or _out-of-band mechanisms_ generate a software token on a server and send it to a resource assumed to be safely controlled by the user. The token can be transmitted to the device in a number of ways:

-   Short Message Service (SMS)—the code is sent as a text to the registered phone number.
    
-   Phone call—the code is delivered as an automated voice call to the registered phone number.
    
-   Push notification—the code is sent to a registered authenticator app on the PC or smartphone.
    
-   Email—the code is sent to a registered email account.
    

These mechanisms are sometimes also described as _2-factor authentication (2FA)_. However, anyone intercepting the code within the time frame could enter it as something you know without ever possessing or looking at the device itself ([auth0.com/blog/why-sms-multi-factor-still-matters](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/2-step-verification)).
