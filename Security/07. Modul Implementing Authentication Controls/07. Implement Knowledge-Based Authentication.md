_Knowledge-based authentication_ refers primarily to issuing users with password-based account access mechanisms. Configuring password-based authentication protocols and supporting users with authentication issues is an important part of the information security role. In this topic, you will learn how some common authentication protocols work and about the ways that they can be put at risk by password cracking techniques.
