# User and Role-based Training

#### USER AND ROLE-BASED TRAINING

Another essential component of a secure system is effective user training. Untrained users represent a serious vulnerability because they are susceptible to social engineering and malware attacks and may be careless when handling sensitive or confidential data.

Appropriate security awareness training needs to be delivered to employees at all levels, including end users, technical staff, and executives. Some of the general topics that need to be covered include the following:

-   Overview of the organization's security policies and the penalties for non-compliance.
    
-   Incident identification and reporting procedures.
    
-   Site security procedures, restrictions, and advice, including safety drills, escorting guests, use of secure areas, and use of personal devices.
    
-   Data handling, including document confidentiality, PII, backup, encryption, and so on.
    
-   Password and account management plus security features of PCs and mobile devices.
    
-   Awareness of social engineering and malware threats, including phishing, website exploits, and spam plus alerting methods for new threats.
    
-   Secure use of software such as browsers and email clients plus appropriate use of Internet access, including social networking sites.
    

There should also be a system for identifying staff performing security-sensitive roles and grading the level of training and education required (between beginner, intermediate, and advanced, for instance). Note that in defining such training programs you need to focus on job roles, rather than job titles, as employees may perform different roles and have different security training, education, or awareness requirements in each role.

> _The NIST National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education framework ([nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/user-and-role-based-training)) sets out knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAAs) for different cybersecurity roles. Security awareness programs are described in SP800-50 ([nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-50.pdf](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/user-and-role-based-training))._
