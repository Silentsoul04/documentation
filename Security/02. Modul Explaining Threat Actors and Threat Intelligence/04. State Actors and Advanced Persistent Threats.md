# State Actors and Advanced Persistent Threats

#### STATE ACTORS AND ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS

Most nation states have developed cybersecurity expertise and will use cyber weapons to achieve both military and commercial goals. The security company Mandiant's APT1 report into Chinese cyber espionage units ([fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/state-actors-and-advanced-persistent-threats)) was hugely influential in shaping the language and understanding of modern cyber-attack life cycles. The term **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** was coined to understand the behavior underpinning modern types of cyber adversaries. Rather than think in terms of systems being infected with a virus or Trojan, an APT refers to the ongoing ability of an adversary to compromise network security—to obtain and maintain access—using a variety of tools and techniques.

**State actors** have been implicated in many attacks, particularly on energy and health network systems. The goals of state actors are primarily espionage and strategic advantage, but it is not unknown for countries—North Korea being a good example—to target companies purely for commercial gain.

State actors will work at arm's length from the national government, military, or security service that sponsors and protects them, maintaining "plausible deniability." They are likely to pose as independent groups or even as hacktivists. They may wage false flag campaigns that try to implicate other states ([media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2019/11/20151759/KSB2019\_APT-predictions-2020\_web.pdf](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/state-actors-and-advanced-persistent-threats)).
