# Criminal Syndicates and Competitors

#### CRIMINAL SYNDICATES AND COMPETITORS

In many countries, cybercrime has overtaken physical crime both in terms of number of incidents and losses. A **criminal syndicate** can operate across the Internet from different jurisdictions than its victim, increasing the complexity of prosecution. Syndicates will seek any opportunity for criminal profit, but typical activities are financial fraud (both against individuals and companies) and extortion.

Most competitor-driven espionage is thought to be pursued by state actors, but it is not inconceivable that a rogue business might use cyber espionage against its competitors. Such attacks could aim at theft or at disrupting a competitor's business or damaging their reputation. Competitor attacks might be facilitated by employees who have recently changed companies and bring an element of insider knowledge with them.
