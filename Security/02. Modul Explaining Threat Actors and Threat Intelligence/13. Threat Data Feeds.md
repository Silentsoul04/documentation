# Threat Data Feeds

#### THREAT DATA FEEDS

When you use a cyber threat intelligence (CTI) platform, you subscribe to a **threat data feed**. The information in the threat data can be combined with event data from your own network and system logs. An analysis platform performs correlation to detect whether any IoCs are present. There are various ways that a threat data feed can be implemented.

**Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)**  
  
The OASIS CTI framework ([oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-data-feeds)) is designed to provide a format for this type of automated feed so that organizations can share CTI. The **Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)** part of the framework describes standard terminology for IoCs and ways of indicating relationships between them.

Where STIX provides the syntax for describing CTI, the**  
Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII)** protocol provides a means for transmitting CTI data between servers and clients. For example, a CTI service provider would maintain a repository of CTI data. Subscribers to the service obtain updates to the data to load into analysis tools over TAXII. This data can be requested by the client (referred to as a collection), or the data can be pushed to subscribers (referred to as a _channel_).

**Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)**  
**Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)** is a service offered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for companies to participate in threat intelligence sharing ([us-cert.gov/ais](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-data-feeds)). It is especially aimed at ISACs, but private companies can join too. AIS is based on the STIX and TAXII standards and protocols.

**Threat Maps**  
A **threat map** is an animated graphic showing the source, target, and type of attacks that have been detected by a CTI platform. The security solutions providers publish such maps showing global attacks on their customers' systems ([fortinet.com/fortiguard/threat-intelligence/threat-map](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-data-feeds)).

**File/Code Repositories**  
A file/code repository such as [virustotal.com](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-data-feeds) holds signatures of known malware code. The code samples derive from live customer systems and (for public repositories) files that have been uploaded by subscribers.

**Vulnerability Databases and Vulnerability Feeds**  
As well as analyzing adversary tools and behaviors, another source of threat intelligence is identifying vulnerabilities in OS, software application, and firmware code. Security researchers look for vulnerabilities, often for the reward of bug bounties offered by the vendor. Lists of vulnerabilities are stored in databases such as **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**, operated by Mitre ([cve.mitre.org](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/threat-data-feeds)). Information about vulnerabilities is codified as signatures and scanning scripts that can be supplied as feeds to automated vulnerability scanning software.
