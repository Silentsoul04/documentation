# Other Threat Intelligence Research Sources

#### OTHER THREAT INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH SOURCES

There are plenty of other sources of best practice advice and new research other than the threat intelligence platforms:

-   Academic journals—results from academic researchers and not-for-profit trade bodies and associations, such as the IEEE, are published as papers in journals. Access to these papers is usually subscription-based. One free source is the arXiv preprint repository ([arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/other-threat-intelligence-research-sources)). Preprints are papers that have not been published or peer reviewed.
-   Conferences—security conferences are hosted and sponsored by various institutions and provide an opportunity for presentations on the latest threats and technologies.
-   Request for Comments (RFC)—when a new technology is accepted as a web standard, it is published as an RFC by the W3C ([rfc-editor.org](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/other-threat-intelligence-research-sources)). There are also informational RFCs covering many security considerations and best practices.
-   Social media—companies and individual researchers and practitioners write informative blogs or social media feeds. There are too many useful blog and discussion sources to include here, but the list curated by Digital Guardian ([digitalguardian.com/blog/top-50-infosec-blogs-you-should-be-reading](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/other-threat-intelligence-research-sources)) is a good starting point.

> _As well as a source of information, social media should also be monitored for threat data ([trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/hunting-threats-on-twitter](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/other-threat-intelligence-research-sources))._
