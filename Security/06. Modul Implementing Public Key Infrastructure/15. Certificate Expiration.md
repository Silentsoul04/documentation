# Certificate Expiration

#### CERTIFICATE EXPIRATION

Certificates are issued with a limited duration, as set by the CA policy for the certificate type. Root certificates might have long expiration dates (10+ years), whereas web server and user certificates might be issued for 1 year only. Typically, a certificate is renewed before it expires. Where a user is in possession of a valid certificate, less administration is required (in terms of checking identity) than with a request for a new certificate. When you are renewing a certificate, it is possible to use the existing key (referred to specifically as _key renewal_) or generate a new key (the certificate is _rekeyed_). A new key might be generated if the old one was no longer considered long enough or if any compromise of the key was feared.

When a certificate expires, there is the question of what to do with the key pair that it represents. A key can either be archived or destroyed. Destroying the key offers more security, but has the drawback that any data encrypted using the key will be unreadable. Whether a key is archived or destroyed will largely depend on how the key was used. In software terms, a key can be destroyed by overwriting the data (merely deleting the data is not secure). A key stored on hardware can be destroyed by a specified erase procedure or by destroying the device.
