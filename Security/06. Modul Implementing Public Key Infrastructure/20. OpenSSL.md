# OpenSSL

#### OPENSSL

In a Windows environment, certificate infrastructure is installed and managed as Active Directory Certificate Services. There is a certutil tool for command line management, or you can use PowerShell.

For Linux, CA services are typically implemented using the OpenSSL suite ([openssl.org](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/openssl-1)). The following represent a few of the many operations that can be accomplished using `openssl` commands.

**Root CA**  
To configure a root CA in OpenSSL, set up a directory structure and adapt an OpenSSL configuration file (openssl.cnf) for any site-local settings. You then need to create an RSA key pair:

`openssl genrsa -aes256 -out cakey.pem 4096`

The `-aes256` argument encrypts the key and requires a password to make use of it. The `4096` argument sets the key length. The output file data is in PEM ASCII format by default. Some sites prefer a naming convention, such as `ca.key`.

The next step is to use this RSA key pair to generate a self-signed root X.509 digital certificate:

`openssl req -config openssl.cnf -key cakey.pem -new -x509 -days 7300 -sha256 -out cacert.pem`

> _This example is simplified. Using a root CA to issue leaf certificates directly is not robust. It is better to create one or more intermediate CAs._

**Certificate Signing Requests**  
To configure a certificate on a host, create a certificate signing request (CSR) with a new key pair. This command is run on the web server:

`openssl req -nodes -new -newkey rsa:2048 -out www.csr -keyout www.key`

Having run the command, you then complete the prompts to enter the subject information for the certificate, taking care to match the common name (CN) to the FQDN by which clients access the server. This key is created without a password, which would have to be input at any restart of the web server application. We can rely on general access control security measures to protect the key.

This CSR file must then be transmitted to the CA server. On the CA, run the following command to sign the CSR and output the X.509 certificate:

`openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -extensions webserver -infiles www.csr -out www.pem`

The passphrase must be entered to confirm use of the `cakey.pem` private key. The `-extensions` argument selects an area of the configuration file for a particular certificate type. This sets the key usage attribute, plus any other extended attributes that are needed.

You can view the new certificate to check the details using the following two commands:

`openssl x509 -noout -text -in www.pem`

`openssl verify -verbose -cafile cacert.pem www.pem`

Transmit the `www.pem` file to the web server and update the server configuration to use it and the `www.key` private key.

**Key and Certificate Management**  
You might export a copy of the private key from this server to be held in escrow as a backup. For this usage, you must password-protect the key:

`openssl rsa -aes256 -in www.key -out www.key.bak`

You might need to convert the certificate format to make it compatible with an application server, such as Java. The following command takes a PEM-encoded certificate and outputs a DER binary-encoded certificate:

`openssl x509 -outform der -in www.pem -out www.der`

Another use case is to export a key and certificate for use in Windows:

`openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey www.key -in www.pem -out www.pfx`
