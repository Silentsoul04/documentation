# Certificate Attributes

#### CERTIFICATE ATTRIBUTES

The X.509 standard defines the fields or attributes that must be present in the certificate. Some of the main fields are listed in the following table.

Field | Usage
----- | -----
Serial number | A number uniquely identifying the certificate within the domain of its CA.
Signature algorithm | The algorithm used by the CA to sign the certificate.
Issuer | The name of the CA.
Valid from/to | Date and time during which the certificate is valid.
Subject | The name of the certificate holder, expressed as a distinguished name (DN). Within this, the common name (CN) part should usually match either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the server or a user email address.
Public key | Public key and algorithm used by the certificate holder.
Extensions | V3 certificates can be defined with extended attributes, such as friendly subject or issuer names, contact email addresses, and intended key usage.
Subject alternative name (SAN) | This extension field is the preferred mechanism to identify the DNS name or names by which a host is identified.
