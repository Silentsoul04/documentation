# Online Certificate Status Protocol Responders

#### ONLINE CERTIFICATE STATUS PROTOCOL RESPONDERS

Another means of providing up-to-date information is to check the certificate's status on an **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)** server, referred to as an _OCSP responder_. Rather than return a whole CRL, this just communicates the status of the requested certificate. Details of the OCSP responder service should be published in the certificate.

> _Most OCSP servers can query the certificate database directly and obtain the real-time status of a certificate. Other OCSP servers actually depend on the CRLs and are limited by the CRL publishing interval._

One of the problems with OCSP is that the job of responding to requests is resource intensive and can place high demands on the issuing CA running the OCSP responder. There is also a privacy issue, as the OCSP responder could be used to monitor and record client browser requests. OCSP **stapling** resolves these issues by having the SSL/TLS web server periodically obtain a time-stamped OCSP response from the CA. When a client submits an OCSP request, the web server returns the time-stamped response, rather than making the client contact the OCSP responder itself.
