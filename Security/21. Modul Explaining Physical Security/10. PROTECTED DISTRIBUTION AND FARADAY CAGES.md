# PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION AND FARADAY CAGES

#### PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION AND FARADAY CAGES

A physically secure cabled network is referred to as protected cable distribution or as a protected distribution system (PDS). There are two principal risks:

-   An intruder could attach eavesdropping equipment to the cable (a tap).
-   An intruder could cut the cable (Denial of Service).

A hardened PDS is one where all cabling is routed through sealed metal conduit and subject to periodic visual inspection. Lower-grade options are to use different materials for the conduit (plastic, for instance). Another option is to install an alarm system within the cable conduit, so that intrusions can be detected automatically.

It is possible to install communications equipment within a shielded enclosure, known as a **Faraday Cage**. The cage is a charged conductive mesh that blocks signals from entering or leaving the area. The risk of eavesdropping from leakage of electromagnetic signals was investigated by the US DoD who defined TEMPEST (Transient Electromagnetic Pulse Emanation Standard) as a means of **shielding** the signals.
