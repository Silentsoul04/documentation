# Implications of IPv6

#### IMPLICATIONS OF IPV6

IPv6 has impacts for premises networks, for the way your company accesses cloud services, and for the way clients access web servers and other public servers that you publish.

IPv6 may be enabled by default on clients and servers, and even on network appliances (routers and firewalls), so there must be a management and security plan for it. If IPv6 is enabled but unmanaged, there is the potential for malicious use as a backdoor or covert channel. IPv6 also exposes novel attack vectors, such as spoofing and DoS attacks on neighbor discovery ([tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/ipv6\_first\_hop](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/implications-of-ipv6)).

Hosts should be allocated IPv6 addresses that map to the same zones as the IPv4 topology. Firewalls should be configured with ACLs that either achieve the same security configuration as for IPv4 or block IPv6, if that is a better option. One issue here is that IPv6 is not intended to perform any type of address translation. Rather than obscure internal/external traffic flows with private to public address mapping, IPv6 routing and filtering policies should be configured to mirror the equivalent IPv4 architecture.

Infoblox's white paper on migrating services to IPv6 provides more useful context ([infoblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/infoblox-whitepaper-seven-deadly-traps-of-ipv6-deployment\_0.pdf](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/implications-of-ipv6))._
