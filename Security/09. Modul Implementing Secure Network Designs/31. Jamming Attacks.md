# Jamming Attacks

#### JAMMING ATTACKS

A wireless network can be disrupted by interference from other radio sources. These are often unintentional, but it is also possible for an attacker to purposefully jam an access point. This might be done simply to disrupt services or to position an evil twin on the network with the hope of stealing data. A Wi-Fi **jamming** attack can be performed by setting up a WAP with a stronger signal. Wi-Fi jamming devices are also widely available, though they are often illegal to use and sometimes to sell. Such devices can be very small, but the attacker still needs to gain fairly close physical proximity to the wireless network.

The only ways to defeat a jamming attack are either to locate the offending radio source and disable it, or to boost the signal from the legitimate equipment. WAPs for home and small business use are not often configurable, but the more advanced wireless access points, such as Cisco's Aironet series, support configurable power level controls. The source of interference can be detected using a **spectrum analyzer**. Unlike a Wi-Fi analyzer, a spectrum analyzer must use a special radio receiver (Wi-Fi adapters filter out anything that isn't a Wi-Fi signal). They are usually supplied as handheld units with a directional antenna, so that the exact location of the interference can be pinpointed.
