# RADIUS Federation

#### RADIUS FEDERATION

Most implementations of EAP use a RADIUS server to validate the authentication credentials for each user (supplicant). RADIUS federation means that multiple organizations allow access to one another's users by joining their RADIUS servers into a RADIUS hierarchy or mesh. For example, when Bob from widget.foo needs to log on to grommet.foo's network, the RADIUS server at grommet.foo recognizes that Bob is not a local user but has been granted access rights and routes the request to widget.foo's RADIUS server.

One example of RADIUS federation is the eduroam network ([eduroam.org](https://course.adinusa.id/sections/radius-federation)), which allows students of universities from several different countries to log on to the networks of any of the participating institutions using the credentials stored by their "home" university.
