> EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED  
> _1.4 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with network attacks  
> 3.3 Given a scenario, implement secure network designs_

A denial of service (DoS) attack can be extremely destructive and very difficult to mitigate. As a network security professional, it is vital for you to be able to compare and contrast DoS and distributed DoS (DDoS) methods and to be able to recommend and configure load balancing technologies that can make networks more resilient to these attacks.
