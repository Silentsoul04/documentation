Attacks aimed at low-level networking functions can be highly effective. To implement a network design that demonstrates confidentiality, integrity, and availability, you must configure switches and routers with appropriate settings. These devices can be used to enforce network access control mechanisms and ensure fault-tolerant paths within the network.
