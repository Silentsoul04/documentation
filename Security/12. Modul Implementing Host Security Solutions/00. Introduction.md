# Modul Implementing Host Security Solutions

#### LESSON INTRODUCTION

Effective network architecture design, protocol configuration, and the use of appliances such as firewalls and intrusion detection help to provide a secure network environment, but we also need to consider the security systems configured on network hosts as well. Security procedures and solutions are complicated by the range of different types of hosts that networks must support, from PCs and laptops to smartphones and embedded controllers.

#### LESSON OBJECTIVES

In this lesson, you will:

-   Implement secure firmware.
  
-   Implement endpoint security.

Explain embedded system security implications.
