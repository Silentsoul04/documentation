# Modul Summarizing Basic Cryptographic Concepts

#### LESSON INTRODUCTION

Assess and monitor activities utilize threat intelligence to identify potential attack vectors detect malicious activity. The protect cybersecurity function aims to build secure IT processing systems that exhibit the attributes of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Many of these secure systems depend wholly or in part on cryptography.

A cryptographic system encodes data in such a way that only authorized persons can decode it. Cryptography is the basis for many of the security systems you will be implementing and configuring. As an information security professional, you must have a good understanding of the concepts underpinning cryptographic algorithms and their implementation in secure protocols and services. All security personnel must be able to contrast the different types of cryptographic ciphers, understand how they can be used to apply data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and describe the weaknesses they may exhibit. A secure technical understanding of the subject will enable you to explain the importance of cryptographic systems and to select appropriate technologies to meet a given security goal.

#### LESSON OBJECTIVES

In this lesson, you will:

-   Compare and contrast cryptographic ciphers.
    
-   Summarize cryptographic modes of operation.
    
-   Summarize cryptographic use cases and weaknesses.
    
-   Summarize other cryptographic technologies.
