A _cipher_ is the particular operations performed to encode or decode data. Modern cryptographic systems make use of symmetric and asymmetric cipher types to encode and decode data. As well as these cipher types, one-way hash functions have an important role to play in many security controls. Being able to compare and contrast the characteristics of these types of cryptographic ciphers and functions is essential for you to deploy security controls for different use cases.
