# VPCS AND TRANSIT GATEWAYS

#### VPCS AND TRANSIT GATEWAYS

Routing can be configured between subnets within a VPC. This traffic can be subject to cloud native ACLs allowing or blocking traffic on the basis of host IPs and ports. Alternatively, traffic could be routed through a virtual firewall instance, or other security appliance.

Connectivity can also be configured between VPCs in the same account or with VPCs belonging to different accounts, and between VPCs and on-premises networks. Configuring additional VPCs rather than subnets within a VPC allows for a greater degree of segmentation between instances. A complex network might split segments between different VPCs across different cloud accounts for performance or compliance reasons.

Traditionally, VPCs can be interconnected using peering relationships and connected with on-premises networks using VPN gateways. These one-to-one VPC peering relationships can quickly become difficult to manage, especially if each VPC must interconnect in a mesh-like structure. A transit gateway is a simpler means of managing these interconnections. Essentially, a **transit gateway** is a virtual router that handles routing between the subnets in each attached VPC and any attached VPN gateways (aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway).
