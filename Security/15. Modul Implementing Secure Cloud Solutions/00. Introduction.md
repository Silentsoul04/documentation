# Modul Implementing Secure Cloud Solutions

#### LESSON INTRODUCTION

The main idea behind cloud computing is that you can access and manage your data and applications from any host, anywhere in the world, while the storage method and location are hidden or abstracted through virtualization. Cloud applications—whether accessed as public services or provisioned over private virtualization infrastructure—are rapidly overtaking on-premises service delivery models. Security in and of the cloud considerations will form an increasingly important part of your career as a security professional.

#### LESSON OBJECTIVES

In this lesson, you will:

-   Summarize secure cloud and virtualization services.
  
-   Apply cloud security solutions.
