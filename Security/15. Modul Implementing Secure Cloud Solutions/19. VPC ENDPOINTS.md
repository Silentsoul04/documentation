# VPC ENDPOINTS

#### VPC ENDPOINTS

A VPC endpoint is a means of publishing a service so that it is accessible by instances in other VPCs using only the AWS internal network and private IP addresses (d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-privatelink.pdf). This means that the traffic is never exposed to the Internet. There are two types of VPC endpoint: gateway and interface.

Gateway Endpoints A gateway endpoint is used to connect instances in a VPC to the AWS S3 (storage) and DynamoDB (database) services. A gateway endpoint is configured as a route to the service in the VPC's route table.

Interface Endpoints An interface endpoint makes use of AWS's PrivateLink feature to allow private access to custom services:

  
-   A custom service provider VPC is configured by publishing the service with a DNS host name. Alternatively, the service provider might be an Amazon default service that is enabled as a VPC interface endpoint, such as CloudWatch Events/Logs.
  
-   A VPC endpoint interface is configured in each service consumer VPC subnet. The VPC endpoint interface is configured with a private IP address within the subnet plus the DNS host name of the service provider.
  
-   Each instance within the VPC subnet is configured to use the endpoint address to contact the service provider.
