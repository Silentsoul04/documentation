# APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES

#### APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES

Whether based SOA or microservices, service integration, automation, and orchestration all depend on application programming interfaces (APIs). The service API is the means by which external entities interact with the service, calling it with expected parameters and receiving the expected output. There are two predominant "styles" for creating web application APIs:

  
-   Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)—uses XML format messaging and has a number of extensions in the form of Web Services (WS) standards that support common features, such as authentication, transport security, and asynchronous messaging. SOAP also has a built-in error handling.
  
-   Representational State Transfer (REST)—where SOAP is a tightly specified protocol, REST is a looser architectural framework, also referred to as RESTful APIs. Where a SOAP request must be sent as a correctly formatted XML document, a REST request can be submitted as an HTTP operation/verb (GET or POST for example). Each resource or endpoint in the API, expressed as a noun, should be accessed via a single URL.
