# INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE

#### INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE

The use of cloud technologies encourages the use of scripted approaches to provisioning, rather than manually making configuration changes, or installing patches. An approach to infrastructure management where automation and orchestration fully replace manual configuration is referred to as **infrastructure as code (IaC)**.

One of the goals of IaC is to eliminate snowflake systems. A snowflake is a configuration or build that is different from any other. The lack of consistency—or drift—in the platform environment leads to security issues, such as patches that have not been installed, and stability issues, such as scripts that fail to run because of some small configuration difference. By rejecting manual configuration of any kind, IaC ensures idempotence. **Idempotence** means that making the same call with the same parameters will always produce the same result. Note that IaC is not simply a matter of using scripts to create instances. Running scripts that have been written ad hoc is just as likely to cause environment drift as manual configuration. IaC means using carefully developed and tested scripts and orchestration runbooks to generate consistent builds.
